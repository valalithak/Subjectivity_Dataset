Syria strikes: All the latest updates

US, UK and France launch attack on 'chemical weapon sites' in Syria. Here are all the latest updates.

The US, UK and France have launched strikes "on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities" in Syria, US President Donald Trump announced early on Saturday.

The strikes came after a suspected chemical weapons attack in the former rebel stronghold of Douma last weekend.

Here are all the latest updates on the strikes: 
Haley: US troops to stay in Syria until goals achieved

    The US will not pull its troops out of Syria until Washington's goals are accomplished, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN said.
    According to Haley, the three aims for the US are ensuring chemical weapons are not used in any way that poses a risk to US interests; Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) is defeated; and there is a good vantage point to watch what Iran is doing.

Putin: Further Syria strikes to cause chaos in international ties

    Russian President Vladimir Putin has told Iranian Presiden Hassan Rouhani that further attacks by Western allies in Syria would inevitably lead to chaos in international relations.

British PM faces backlash for bypassing MPs on Syria

    Prime Minister Theresa May faced backlash from the domestic opposition after launching military strikes on Syria without consulting parliament.
    As the Conservative leader explained her rationale for the air strikes, opposition parties claimed the attacks were legally dubious, risked escalating conflict and should have been approved by legislators.
    The shadow of the 2003 invasion of Iraq still lingers in the corridors of Britain's parliament, when MPs backed then-prime minister Tony Blair in joining US military action.
    "Bombs won't save lives or bring about peace," said Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party

Syria: Strikes hit 'parts of but not the heart' of programme

    A former officer in Syria's chemical programme says the joint strikes were unlikely to curb the government's ability to produce chemical weapons or launch new attacks.
    Speaking from rebel-held northern Syria, Adulsalam Abdulrazek told the Associated Press news agency there were an estimated 50 warehouses that stored chemical weapons before the programme was dismantled in 2013. He said he believed those facilities remain or were slightly moved.
    He said the suspected chemical weapons programme was only partially dismantled under the Syria Chemical Weapons Disarmament Deal of 2013 [between the US and Russia] because the Assad government did not allow inspections of existing stockpiles and capabilities.

NATO chief Stoltenberg: All NATO allies back Syria air strikes 

    NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Saturday that all NATO allies back Syria air strikes carried out by the US, UK and France on chemical weapons targets in Syria.
    He said the strikes were "intended to degrade the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capability" and deter further chemical attacks on civilians such as the one in Douma.
    He called on Russia and "all supporters of the Syrian regime" to "exercise responsibility" in the Syrian conflict.

Haley: If Syria uses toxic gas again, the US is 'locked and loaded'

    Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN, has described the Syria strikes as "justified, legitimate and proportionate".
    "The United States and its allies did everything we could to use the tools of diplomacy to get rid of Assad's arsenal of chemical weapons. We did not give diplomacy just one chance. We gave diplomacy chance after chance - six times, that's how much Russia vetoed Security Council resolutions to address chemical weapons in Syria," she said.
    "I spoke to the US president this morning and he said that if the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded. When our president draws a red line, our president enforces the red line."

Chemical inspectors from The Hague arrive in Syria

    In an announcement on social media, OPCW said it will "commence its work" on the investigation of the use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians in Douma. 
    The work of the organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, is significant as it will determine the veracity of chemical weapons use. But it would not be able to determine who was responsible for the attack. 

Turkey's Erdogan says strikes on Syria 'appropriate'

    Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the US-led operation in Syria, calling it an "appropriate" response to the recent chemical attack on civilians.
    Binali Yildirim, Turkey's prime minister, added that it was a "positive step", saying the people in Syria "have been slaughtered for seven years".

Pentagon: US air strikes dealt a 'severe blow' to Syria

    Lieutenant-General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr, director of joint staff, said the US air strikes delivered a "severe blow" to Syria's chemical weapons production capability. He said the operation is "far more damaging to Syria".
    McKenzie also said that none of its missiles was intercepted, and that all weapons hit the targets at their designated time of target of about 4am local time in Syria. 
    McKenzie said the US military is "ready anytime" in case of retaliation.
    Dana W White, Pentagon spokesperson, said the use of chemical weapons is an "inexcusable violation of "international law". She said the US "successfully hit all targets".
