India's Manushi Chhillar crowned Miss World 2017

Miss India Manushi Chhilar wins the 67th Miss World contest final in Sanya, on the tropical Chinese island of Hainan on November 18, 2017. 

Miss India World 2017 Manushi Chhillar, a 20-year-old from Haryana, won the coveted Miss World 2017 pageant here on Saturday, 16 years after Priyanka Chopra won the title in 2000.

Chhillar, a medical student, competed against 108 contestants from various countries at a glittering event held at Sanya City Arena.
Miss World 2016 winner Puerto Rico's Stephanie Del Valle gave away the coveted crown to the winner.

The first and the second runners-up were Miss England Stephanie Hill and Miss Mexico Andrea Meza.

The coveted title was last won by Priyanka Chopra for India in 2000, a year after Yukta Mookhey had made the country proud.

In 1997, Diana Hayden had bagged the title, while Aishwarya Rai had the honours in 1994. Reita Faria was the first Indian to win the crown in the 1966.

Chhillar had earlier this year won the Femina Miss India 2017.

Born to doctor parents, she studied in St Thomas School in New Delhi and Bhagat Phool Singh Government Medical College for Women in Sonepat.

Her entire family, including brother and sister, were present at the pageant.
