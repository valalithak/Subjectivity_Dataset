The eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit with a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and a subsequent tsunami that hurled water as high as 20 feet over the city of Palu. Officials said Monday evening that more than 1,200 people had been confirmed killed. Residents of Palu have spent the last few days identifying their dead. Since the disasters, stores have been looted, residents have gone hungry and there have been mass jail breaks. Some nonprofit organizations and charities have mobilized to bring relief to the island. If you want to help those affected by the earthquake and tsunami, here is some guidance, and a list of some of the organizations involved in recovery efforts. Sending money is usually the most efficient way to help in a disaster, experts say. Sending goods like water bottles and canned and dry food can be helpful, but thereâ€™s a risk that the items will be misplaced or forgotten. It might also take more time to get the goods to people with immediate needs. Regardless of this guide or what is donated, it is important to research a charity or organization before donating.
