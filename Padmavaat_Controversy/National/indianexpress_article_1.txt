Padmavati controversy: As the film gets clearance from CBFC, hereâ€™s a timeline of the hurdles it faced		
Padmavati, now presumably Padmavat, has been a topic of discussion ever since the film's shoot started. From lead actor Deepika Padukone receiving death threats to rewards being announced on beheading director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the film received a number of threats from political and religious organisations as they found the film's content objectionable. But now, after a long battle, the audience may get to watch the artwork of Bhansali soon. Central Board of Film Certification has made up its mind about clearing the film with a few modifications, one of which includes a change in the film's title. The CBFC has suggested renaming the magnum opus, Padmavat. The film starring Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor in the lead roles is said to be inspired by an epic poem, Padmavat by the 16th century Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi, but the director of the movie Bhansali has a different tale to tell. He says that he got inspiration for the movie and for Deepika's role from 1966 film Amrapali. Here's a timeline of the controversies that have surrounded the film Padmavati so far: Accident on the sets: A painter who was working on the larger than life sets of the movie fell from the height of five feet in December 2016. Sanjay Leela Bhansali tried to compensate for the accident and Deepika too expressed grief on the demise of the man. shocked and saddened by the news may his soul rest in peace and my most sincere condolences to his family Deepika Padukone (@deepikapadukone) December 25, 2016, Vandalism on sets in Jaipur: In January 2017,the sets of the movie at Jaigarh Fort in Jaipur were destroyed by the members of Karni Sena who staged an angry protest against the director of the movie Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Protesters entered in large numbers and started getting violent with Bhansali. Even as his team tried to shield him and take him to safety, the mob unleashed its fury on the defenceless director and slapped and assaulted him. Their next target was the costly film equipment which was smashed on the ground. The incident halted the shooting of the movie for days. Sanjay Leela Bhansali Slapped And Assaulted By Protesters On Padmavati Sets In Jaipur, Vandalism on sets in Kolhapur: In March 2017, once again the sets of Padmavati were vandalised in Kolhapur's Masai plateau during the night and were set on fire hurting the animals which were present at the time of the incident. About 20 to 30 people reached the sets of the film armed with petrol bombs, stones and lathis. Before putting the set of the movie on fire, they torched the fodder kept for animals and even destroyed the costumes kept there. The attacks were being staged as certain fringe Rajput groups claimed that the film has a dream sequence where Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji will be seen in an intimate position. The claims were dismissed by the team of the movie. Here are the pictures from Padmavati's Kolhapur 
The first poster: In September 2017 Deepika Padukone's first look poster was released.

Narain Singh Divrala, district president Jaipur of the Rajput Karni Sena, told IANS, We want him to show the film to the core committee of Shri Rajput Karni Sena and various organizations, including historians, before releasing it. Till then we will not allow the film to be released. If the Karni Sena core committee and historians don't have any problems only then will we allow screening of the movie. Threatening to burn cinema halls: According to the reports, the Jai Rajputana Sangh said that they won't tolerate any distortion of facts and if there will be any romantic relationship between Rani Padmavati and Allaudin Khilji, they will burn the cinema halls. However, Smriti Irani assured Bhansali that the movie will release without any trouble. Goons destroy rangoli: In October 2017, the movie got embroiled in another controversy when goons destroyed an artist's 48 hours of hard work in less than a minute. It was Surat artist Karan K's rangoli which featured Deepika Padukone in her character in Padmavati. It was after Deepika drew the attention of Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani on the incident that Surat police arrested five people for allegedly vandalising the rangoli.
