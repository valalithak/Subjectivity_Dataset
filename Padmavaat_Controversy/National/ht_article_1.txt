Padmaavat and the long trail of controversies: A timeline of obstacles the film has faced
 After staying the ban on release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali‚Äôs Padmaavat, imposed by four states, the Supreme Court dismissed pleas from state government requesting reversal of its order and cleared all decks for a pan-India release of the Deepika Padukone-Ranveer Singh-starrer on January 25 on Monday.  
However, there seems to be no end to the troubles en route to the release. Despite the top court‚Äôs orders, various incidents of violent protests have been reported in Gujarat, Gurgaon and Rajasthan. Several factions of the fringe group Karni Sena have also threatened ‚Äúcurfew‚Äù if theatres screen Padmaaavat. As a result, most theatre owners in Gujarat have decided not to screen the film. 
Here‚Äôs the entire timeline of the controversies:
December, 2016: Sanjay Leela Bhansali started preparing for his biggest film till date. However, he had to stop shooting for a few days because a worker died on the sets of the film after falling from a stand. Deepika Padukone offered condolences on Twitter.
shocked and saddened by the news...may his soul rest in peace and my most sincere condolences to his family...üôè
January, 2017: Bhansali was slapped and assaulted by the members of Karni Sena who staged an angry protest at Jaigarh fort in Jaipur where Bhansali was shooting for Padmavati. In a viral video, protesters were seen running amok, damaging cameras and other shooting equipment while raising slogans and spewing abuses in Hindi. 
March, 2017: After facing roadblock in Rajasthan, Bhansali shifted his sets to Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Little did he know that men armed with petrol bombs and swords will attack his film‚Äôs sets. However, they did and vandalised the sets. After this incident, Bhansali reached a truce with the protesting organisations. In a letter that surfaced on Twitter, the filmmaker has clarified to the Rajput associations that there is no ‚Äúromantic dream sequence or anything objectionable‚Äù between Rani Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji in the movie
