 President Ramnath Kovind administered the oath of office to Mr. Naidu, at a brief ceremony in the Durbar Hall of Rashtrapati Bhawan attended by political leaders cutting across party lines.
 Wearing his trademark white panche (dhoti) and white shirt, Mr. Naidu took oath in Hindi in the name of God.
 While he is the 15th Vice-President, he is the 13th person to hold the constitutional post. His predecessor Hamid Ansari and India's first Vice-President S. Radhakrishnan had held the post for two consecutive terms.
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Ansari, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, BJP veteran L K Advani, several Union Ministers, Governors and Chief Ministers attended the ceremony.
 SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, NCP\u2019s Tariq Anwar, CPI leader D Raja, TMC leaders Sudip Bandhopadhyay and Derek O\u2019 Brien and AIADMK\u2019s O Panneerselvam were also seen.
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar \u2014\u2014 who has joined hands with the BJP in his state \u2014\u2014 also attended the ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhawan.

 Mr.Naidu\u2019s wife M. Usha was also present.
 Born in a humble agricultural family in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Nellore district, Mr. Naidu has served as BJP president, Union Minister and held various portfolios and a long-time Rajya Sabha member.
 This remarkable career in politics has been more than four decades in the making.
 \n\n, It began in the 1970s when BJP\u2019s precursor Jana Sangh was a marginal player with little clout in the south and a young party worker kept himself busy putting up posters of stalwarts such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani.
 Mr. Naidu has come a long way since those days of political obscurity.
