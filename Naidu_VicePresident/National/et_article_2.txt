BJP's acronym man Venkaiah Naidu becomes India's new vice-president. Here is all you need to know
NEW DELHI: After Ram Nath Kovind, NDA candidate Muppavarapu Venkaiah Naidu (68) has been elected as India's 15th Vice-president today. 

With today's result, for the first time in the history, BJP leaders would occupy top four constitutional posts of the country. All these posts would be rendered "Congress-mukt". President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan all come from BJP. 

In final vote count, Naidu received 516 votes out of 760 valid votes polled today, while opposition candidate Gopal Krishna Gandhi managed to get the support of 244 parliamentarians. The result even exceeded the BJP's own expectation as according to reports 19 opposition parties also voted in support of NDA candidate. 

Unlike the presidential election held recently, in which the electoral college also includes MLAs of all state assemblies and union territories, only MPs of the two Houses can vote in the vice-presidential election.

Two time vice-president Hamid Ansari's term is ending on August 10 and Naidu will take oath the next day. By virtue of being vice-president, Naidu will also become the ex-officio chairman of the Rajya Sabha, where BJP has less numbers.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Naidu for becoming the vice-president.
