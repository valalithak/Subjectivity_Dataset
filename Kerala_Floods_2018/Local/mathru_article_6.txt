Thodupuzha: The volume of water being released from Idukki dam is likely to be increased in the wake of the water level in the dam inching towards 2403 ft.
A decision may be taken in this regard by this noon.
Presently, 15 lakh litres of water is being released from the dam per second.  The KSEB authorities are thinking of increasing the water being released from the dam to 17 lakh litres.
15 lakh litres of water will be released till the water level in the dam reaches 2403 ft. When the water level reaches 2403 ft, the  volume of water released will be increased to 17 lakh litres per second.
The situation is such that the volume of water being released from Mullaperiyam dam have to be increased any moment. If the water from Mullaperiyar also reaches Idukki dam, the water level in the dam will increase alarmingly.
The authorities are thinking of releasing more water from the dam as a preparatory step to deal with such a situation.
Meanwhile, the volume of water being released from Idamalayar has been reduced.  According to reports, the water level in Idamalayar is decreasing. 


Hence, authorities estimate that there will be no difference in the water level in Periyar river even if the water being released from Idukki dam is increased.
