New Delhi:  Saradh Chandra, Director of flood-forecast monitoring at Central Water Commission (CWC) said Wednesday that the opening of dams did not cause floods in Kerala.
"Heavy incessant rains resulted in the floods. We will seek a report from Kerala on the floods," he said.
The Central Water Commission has rejected the contention that the sudden opening of dams was the cause of floods.
"Continuous heavy rains resulted in the floods. The topographical characteristics of the state was also a crucial factor. Even if the dams were opened earlier, it would not have made a significant impact as the water level rose very fast," Saradh Chandra said. 


The commission is preparing a final study report on the floods and has sought details from Kerala, Saradh Chandra said.
