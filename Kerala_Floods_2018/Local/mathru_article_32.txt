Employees and workers of various departments, who have reported for duty at Pampa and Sabarimala are safe, the Devaswom Board informed.
The bridges in Pampa and Triveni are submerged in water. Traffic was disrupted after trees were uprooted in several places on the forest road. 
The KSRTC has stopped the bus service to Pampa. The resting centre and majority of buildings and hotels from Pampa to Ganapathy Temple are surrounded by water.
Police have erected barricades in Pampa to close the roads.
The  Devaswom Board has asked the police to block the vehicles coming to Pampa at Nilackal  and to send them back.
Presently, the Sabarimala Melshanthi and aides, Devaswom empoloyees and Malikappuram Melshanthi are staying in Sabarimala.
The temple Thanthri has not reached Sannidhanam due to the heavy rain and floods.  The Thanthri and his team including the Sabarimala Executive officer had tried to reach the Sannidhanam via Vandiperiyar Pulmedu route yesterday.  However, the adverse weather halted their journey at Upputhara.   They are trying to reach Sabarimala by evening with the help of Forest officials.
