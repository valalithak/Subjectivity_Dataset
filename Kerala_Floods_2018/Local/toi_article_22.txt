CM announces Design Incubator for start-ups to rebuild Kerala
KOCHI: Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that his government is planning to set up a 'Design Incubatorâ for start-ups to offer design solutions to rebuild the flood-ravaged state. "It is to bring in design skills for sustainable living,â Vijayan said. He was addressing the two-day #Design Kerala Summit that concluded on Wednesday. âKerala faced the centuryâs worst devastating floods and the challenge to rebuild Kerala is what lies ahead of us. We thought of getting the global expertise and ideas in design thinking to rebuild and re-imagine Kerala,â he said, welcoming design thinkers from across the world to the Kochi design week at Bolghatty Convention Centre. The design week is set to conclude on December 16. The chief minister said, âRecent floods reveal that climate change and global warming effects are already affecting us and we are facing the result of our indiscriminate action. We can reverse that if we put our hearts and minds into it to create and environment for sustainable living through waste management, and reducing carbon footprint.â Citing examples of design thinking for sustainable living, he said, Kerala has the first solar powered airport in the world and first in the country to design humanoid robot to clean manholes. âWe walk the talk, as our start-ups have developed the technology for sustainable living through design thinking for social development and human transformation,â he said. The aim of this first Design Summit in Kerala was to bring global design experts here to offer design solutions in rebuilding Kerala after the floods set on the core theme `design a sustainable ecosystem for the futureâ, CMâs IT fellow Arun Balachandran said.
