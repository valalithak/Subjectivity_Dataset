Thiruvananthapuram: Putting Keralites in distress after the flood, the Centre has rejected Kerala government's request that subsidised kerosene should be provided to the flood-hit state.
As a result, the state will have to purchase kerosene at higher rates. 
The state government had requested the Centre to distribute kerosene after the power lines got disconnected and distribution of LPG cylinder got disrupted.
Kerala needs at least Rs 83 crore to purchase 12000 kilolitres of kerosene without subsidy. In this situation, the state government has decided not to purchase non-subsidised kerosene.
Though Kerala had requested kerosene at subsidised rates, the Centre has informed the government that kerosene will be given without subsidy.
To purchase this kerosene Kerala will have to pay Rs 83 crore at the rate Rs 70 per litre.
At present, one litre kerosene is given to customers who have electricity connection and five litres is given to those who have no electricity at home.
If Kerosene purchased at non-subsidised rate reaches the customer, it will be more expensive.


Meanwhile, the civil supplies department has not taken a final decision on purchasing kerosene which will result in a liability of Rs 83 crore. It is reported that the state would not purchase the allotted kerosene if subsidy is not given. According to the government, purchasing kerosene at a high rate than diesel, is not practical.
