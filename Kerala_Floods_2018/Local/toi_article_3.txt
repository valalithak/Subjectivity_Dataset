Kerala floods: Dairy farmers in Alappuzha badly hit, forced to sell cows
ALAPPUZHA: Dairy farmers and poultry farmers suffered huge losses in the flood-ravaged state. Milk production came down by 17,000 litres per day in the Alappuzha district. Animal husbandry department's (AHD) district officer P C Sunilkumar said out of 600 cows killed in the flood, over 510 were productive cows. "Though many cows survived the flood, their milk production has come down drastically following they were affected by various disease like mastitis and stress," he said. However, following the shortage of food and grass for cattle, the dairy farmers in Kuttanad were forced to sell their milking cows at lower prices which were inevitable part of their life for the past many years. A 51-year-old dairy farmer Bhuvanachandran Thekke Chavara, Kainakary, said he has two cows and a calf. He got 50 kg cattle feed free of cost from the government two weeks back. ``But it could be served only for seven days for his cows and now he is buying cattle feed paying higher price. The price of 50 kg cattle feed is Rs 960. It is not affordable. All the grass in our village vanished in the flood and the government should take steps for allotting more free cattle feeds. Otherwise, we may be forced to sell our cows as the milk production has come down following various health issues. All our cows are under depression and the doctors are not giving any advice to us and medicines for our cows to overcome this current situation. Now a cow, which produced at least nine litre milk per day, is producing only four litre milk," he said. According to animal husbandry department, 660 cows perished in the flood creating a loss of Rs 3.94 crores. Over 104 cows went with flood waters creating a loss of Rs 67.4 lakh. Over 258 heifers were killed causing a loss of Rs 38.56 lakh and 189 claves also perished creating a loss of Rs 18.1 lakh in flood. At least 1,399 goats and 1,20,696 chickens died creating a loss of 96.37 lakhs and Rs 1.39 crore respectively. Around 94888 ducks perished creating a loss of Rs 1.41 crore. 12,50,000 ducks eggs were damaged in the flood creating a loss of Rs 75 lakh. Over 4501 quail were swallowed by flood waters creating a loss of Rs1.44 lakhs. The animal husbandry department officials said the district suffered a heavy loss of Rs 140115709 due to the death of domestic animals and birds in the flood in the district. "The dairy farmers will overcome the present condition and the milk production will go high. We are providing all the help for saving the life of surviving cows and medicines and treatments are available in all the veterinary hospitals. If a dairy farmer faces any problem, he or she can call their veterinary doctor concerned and we would provide all the care and treatment to their animals," said the district officer of AHD.
