Malappuram: Minister KT Jaleel visited Haneefa who had joined the rescue operations and lost his livelihood means when the floods ravaged the state. Haneefa, a native of Thanoor is living in a rented house at boat jetty road. When he was engaged in the rescue mission, he lost his fishing equipment.
His fishing net which costs lakhs of rupees was damaged in the floods. He took his fishing equipment out of his fibre boat in order to accommodate more people during the rescue mission. But when the mission was over, he lost all equipment which is necessary to continue his job. His fishing net was completely submereged in mud. 
He rescued over 200 families in his fibre boat by battling alone in the floods. But his life fell in trouble when the floods were over.
He incurred a loss of Rs 5 lakh. Haneefa who was an expatriate, had sold his 4 cent land to purchase his fibre boat and fishing equipment.


Mathrubhumi had reported the pathetic story of Haneefa earlier.
