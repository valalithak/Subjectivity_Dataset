New Delhi: The Ministry of Earth Sciences had issued heavy rain alert to Kerala, said sources. The Ministry claimed that they had issued an alert on heavy rain in Idukki, Pathanamthitta and Wayanad districts.
Dr. M Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), told Mathrubhumi News that a red alert was issued for Kerala three days before the heavy downpour.
“The state should have maintained alertness on receiving the red alert as the water level in dams rose in July itself” said Rajeevan.


“But I am not blaming anyone on this issue. The Ministry had informed Kerala that the state will receive heavy rainfall on August 4 and August 14,” Dr. M Rajeevan added.
