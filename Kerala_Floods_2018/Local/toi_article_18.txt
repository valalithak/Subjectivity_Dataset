Centre's aid for flood-hit state not sufficient: CM Pinarayi Vijayan
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan flayed the Centre for not responding to the demand for a special financial package for rebuilding the state after the flood. "Till date, the Centre has given only Rs 600 crore," the CM said. "This is happening when the state has submitted a proposal for a compensation of Rs 4,796 crore and an additional Rs 5,000 crore as a special financial package. The total loss caused to the state is Rs 31,000 crore as per the report submitted by the international agencies like the UN and the World Bank," said the chief minister. The Centre is neglecting all the demands made by the state after the devastating flood. The request for getting help from foreign countries was objected. The attempt to mobilise funds from the Malayalis settled in various countries by state ministers visiting these countries were also objected, he added. The chief minister's distress relief fund has received Rs 2,683.18 crore from July 27 to November 21. The total fund received at the state disaster relief fund is Rs 958.23 crore which includes the Rs 600 crore received from the Centre. As per the estimates, the funds required for repairing the houses that got damaged in the flood and for constructing new houses for those who have lost the entire property is Rs 1,357 crore. In addition, this is the compensation for the loss of crops and agricultural land. The seriousness and the gravity of the damages caused were seen by the central team and even Union home minister Rajnath Singh. But the Centre has turned a blind eye to the demands of the state, said the CM. "When one district was affected by flood in Karnataka, the Centre had sanctioned Rs 546 crore and for Uttarakhand, the Centre had given Rs 2,300 crore," he said. "When Chennai was hit with severe floods, the Centre gave Rs 940 crore. But when it comes to Kerala, Centre's attitude is a lacklustre one," alleged the CM.
