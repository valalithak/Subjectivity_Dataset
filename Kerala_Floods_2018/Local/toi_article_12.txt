CM Pinarayi Vijayan meets PM, seeks Rs 5,000cr special grant
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala has sought a special grant of Rs 5,000 crore from the Centre for rebuilding efforts and Rs 4,796 crore from the national disaster response fund in the wake of the devastating floods. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan raised these demands in his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Tuesday evening. "The Prime Minister spent a considerable time listening to our demands and he gave a very positive response. He has assured help from all departments," Vijayan said. The central team, which visited the state, is expected to submit its report in the first week of October. Several agencies like World Bank, ADB and UNDP will also be submitting their reports to the Centre. The chief minister said the agencies have already assessed a total compensation package of Rs 25,000 crore for rebuilding the state. The state government has urged the Centre to increase its borrowing rate to 4.5% of the GDP from the present 3% in the present financial year. It has also sought to keep the borrowing limit at 3.5% in the next financial year so that the state can take loans up to Rs 16,000 crore in the next two years. The other demands of the state include increasing the allotment in central-sponsored housing schemes by 10%.
