Thiruvananthapuram: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday said that the flood central assistance provided for flood affected Kerala was insufficient. Speaking to reporters at Thiruvananthapuram he said that Kerala had hoped for better aids when union ministers visited flood-hit regions.
“Centre provided Rs 546 crore to Karnataka when flood affected one of its districts. It gave Rs 2300 crore for Uttarakhand and had given Rs 940 crores for Chennai when flood affected in 2015. At the same time, Kerala was ignored,” CM alleged.
“Central government is showing serious ignorance in compensating flood loss. They have provided only Rs 600 crore. The state government will have to pay support price for the ration provided during flood. This will amount to Rs 265.74 crore. Hence in effect the aid provided will be only Rs 334.26 crore”.
Pinarayi Vijayan also blamed the union government on not sanctioning the foreign visits of Kerala ministers seeking aid. Not only they disapproved the foreign aid we obtained, they also cancelled the visits of Kerala ministers that was scheduled so as to seek aids from Malayalees abroad.
CM said that Kerala has requested for Rs 5616 crore for compensating losses that incurred as part of monsoon and Rs 5000 crore as a special package. The study conducted by World Bank officials and UN representatives have estimated a loss of Rs 31000 crore. Kerala has applied for a loan of Rs 2500 crore at NABARD.
CM demanded to make available loans from World Bank and ADB. He also demanded for the implementation of various central government projects.  


“CMDRF has received Rs 2683.18 crore during the time period from July 27 2018 to November 21 2018. SDRF has received Rs 958.23 crore. Government in total has Rs 3641.91 crore. At the same time the distress relief fund expenses and those compensations decided by the cabinet together will require Rs 1950.18 crore and to rebuild houses it will require Rs 1357 crore, he added.
