Relief materials at international airport cleared
Thiruvananthapuram: The massive task of clearing relief materials that reached the international airport from various national and international destinations has been completed by the district administration after overcoming all hurdles. Following suspension of operations at Cochin International Airport, around 340 tonnes of relief goods, donated by various collectives mainly from Gulf countries, had reached Trivandrum International Airport. District collector K Vasuki said that out of the 340 tonnes, about 271 tonnes of perishable materials, including food items and other necessary items, got customs clearance and were sent to the flood-devastated districts such as Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Ernakulam. âWith the joint effort of central customs department, state revenue department and Kerala State Industrial Enterprises, huge amount of materials that we received from international destinations has been distributed without any delay and the pending stock is only 79 tonnes,ââsaid the district collector.  She added, âto get cargoes addressed specifically to individuals and organizations, people should contact the customs department as well as state relief agency.â According to G Vivekanand, assistant commissioner, central tax & central excise, every stakeholder involved should ensure that international cargoes should reach the affected people without any hurdles. âSince the relief materials that arrived at air cargo complex were for a public cause, customs have given duty exemption to those goods,â said Vivekanand. He also added that the customs will contact the recipients and make them understand that the procedures for collecting their goods are not that hard. âSince it is duty-free there are certain parameters but they are not too tough,â said Vivekanand.
