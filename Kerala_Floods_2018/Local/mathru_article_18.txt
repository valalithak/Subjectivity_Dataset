Thiruvananthapuram: The Indian Air Force has asked Kerala to pay Rs 25 crore for its rescue works during the devastating floods in August.
Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan informed the Assembly in a special statement that the state had to pay a total of Rs 290 crore for the aircrafts that were pressed into service during the floods and the food grains provided by the central government.
Although the Pinarayi Vijayan did not reveal how much the state had to pay the IAF, the CM’s office informed that the IAF had issued a bill of Rs 25 crore.


The IAF bill comes at a time when the government is struggling to find financial resources to rebuild the state. However, the IAF sources said that it was normal to seek payment for relief and rescue missions. The centre has already sought payment for food grains provided to the state.
