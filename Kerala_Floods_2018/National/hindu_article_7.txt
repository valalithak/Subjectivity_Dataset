 [][][\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi. File\n\xa0 ][Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed solidarity with\xa0Kerala\xa0and said that people from all walks of life across the country have come in support of those whose lives were devastated in the massive floods.
 \u201cIn today\u2019s pressing, hard times, the entire nation is with Kerala. Our sympathies are with those families who lost their loved ones. Loss of lives cannot be compensated, but I assure the\xa0grief-stricken families\xa0that in this moment of suffering and misery, 125 crore Indians stand by them,\u201d Mr. Modi said in his monthly \u201cMann Ki Baat\u201d programme.
 \u201cI earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon. I firmly believe that the sheer grit and courage of the people of the State will see Kerala rise again,\u201d he added.
 \n\n, The Prime Minister said that while the monsoon, on one hand, brings a new ray of hope to the toiling farmers and provides much needed succour to the scorched trees and shrubs and to parched water bodies, on the other hand excessive rainfall causes devastating floods.
 \u201cDisasters, unfortunately leave behind a trail of destruction. But one gets to witness facets of humanity, humaneness during disasters,\u201d Mr. Modi said.
 \n, \nWhen Mahatma Gandhi mobilised \u20b96,000 for flood relief in Kerala\n, \u201cFrom Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is endeavouring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes, be it Kerala or any other part of India, human life returns to normalcy. Irrespective of age group or area of work, people are contributing,\u201d he said.
 Mr. Modi commended the armed forces involved in the\xa0rescue and relief operations\xa0in the State for \u201cleaving no stone unturned as saviours of those trapped in the floods\u201d.
 \u201cI would like to specially mention the arduous endeavours of the National Disaster Response Force daredevils. At this moment of hardship and agony, their service stands out as a shining example,\u201d he said.
 (IANS), A large number of \u201cdaughters\u201d from India winning medals in the Asian Games, underway in Indonesia, is a positive sign, Mr. Modi said in his speech..
 He said podium finish in those sports in which the country has not performed well in the past is an evidence of the sky-high spirit of the players.
 He said the attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games and every morning people look at newspapers, TV and social media to check if Indian players have won medals.
 \u201cI wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country. I extend my best wishes to those players who are yet to compete.
 \u201cIndian players are performing exceedingly well in shooting and wrestling but our players are winning medals in those competitions too in which our performance has not been so good earlier,\u201d the PM said.
 He said medals in sports such as Wushu and rowing are not just medals but an evidence of the sky-high spirits of the Indian players.
 \u201cAmong those winning medals for our country are a large number of our daughters which is a very positive sign; so much so, that youngsters of only 15-16 years of age... This too is a very positive indication that most of the medal-winners hail from small towns and villages,\u201d he said.
 Wishing people ahead of National Sports Day on August 29, Mr. Modi requested the public to make it a point to take up sports and take care of their fitness.
 \u201cBecause only a healthy India will build a developed and prosperous India. When India will be fit, only then India\u2019s future will be bright,\u201d he said.
