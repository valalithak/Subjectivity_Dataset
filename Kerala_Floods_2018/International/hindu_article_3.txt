 [][][][Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday offered to help flood-hit Kerala. The Pakistani leader\u2019s comments came in the backdrop of growing criticism of the Indian government\u2019s decision to decline foreign aid for flood relief and rehabilitation in the State.
 \u201cOn behalf of the people of Pakistan, we send our prayers and best wishes to those who have been devastated by the floods in Kerala, India. We stand ready to provide any humanitarian assistance that may be needed,\u201d the newly elected Prime Minister of Pakistan said in a social media post that drew widespread appreciation among his social media followers in Pakistan and Gulf countries.
 Islamabad\u2019s statement came a day after India said it would depend on \u201cdomestic resources\u201d for providing short and long term help in Kerala. \u201cIn line with the existing policy, the government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson said on Wednesday.
 It was understood that by \u2018existing policy\u2019, the MEA was indicating at the decision taken in 2004 to avoid foreign support in the context of the deadly tsunami that affected a large number of countries in the Indian Ocean region.
 However, India\u2019s decision to decline aid from abroad drew criticism from veteran diplomats and officials who said that the Central government should have been more considerate regarding the offer of support from the Gulf countries, especially from the United Arab Emirates that has offered \u20b9700 crore.
 \u201c\u2026as country we can give rather than take assistance, but 80% Indians in the Gulf are Malayalis. Offer of flood relief assistance from region must be treated with sensitivity. Saying no is simple, but for Kerala-in-crisis, it\u2019s not so simple,\u201d said former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao.
 Former Foreign Secretary and National Security Adviser Shiv Shankar Menon made a distinction between foreign support for immediate relief and long term rehabilitation. \u201c\u2026the 2004 decision was not to accept foreign participation in relief but accept it for long term rehabilitation case by case,\u201d said Mr. Menon, elaborating that rescue teams in Kerala required no foreign help, but such help could be utilised for \u201crebuilding houses, bridges, roads etc.\u201d, Some diplomats have however maintained that the issue of aid for Kerala should be resolved through internal consultation at the earliest to avoid any long term fallout. \u201cIt appears that the offer from UAE came without prior consultation with India,\u201d said former Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal.][Please enter a valid email address.
