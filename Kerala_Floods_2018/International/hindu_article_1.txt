But the stripped down version of the sadya \u2014 the feast \u2014 will have only sambar, thoran and pappadam followed by one variety of payasam. \u201cThe leaves have already arrived from Chennai, and but for that, there is no celebration. There will be a mass prayer for Kerala before the meal. All the money saved will go for rebuilding Kerala,\u201d said Sasi Menon, a former chairman of the temple committee and the lead for the Onam event. , Malayali associations, temples, and churches across the United States and Canada have either cancelled or scaled down Onam celebrations planned for this weekend to support relief and rebuilding efforts in Kerala as the State recovers from the worst flood in a century. Other linguistic groups that are usually enthusiastic participants in the Onam celebrations of Malayalees are generously contributing to the kitty. \u201cWe have collected $50,000 already. We are hoping to collect $20,000 from the Gujarati community over the weekend,\u201d said Sam Anto of the Kerala Association of Nashville, Tennessee. , Ranjith Menon, a World Bank official who coordinates a group of Malayalis at the workplace called Malayali Mesa, mobilised $10,000 with support from all communities. An event in Chicago on August 26 has two dozen organisations participating, such as the Telugu Association of North America and the Aurora Indian Community Outreach. Though Malayalees are taking the initiative, there is an outpouring of support from all communities, said Jose Abraham, general secretary of the Federation of Malayalee Associations of Americas (FOMAA). Mr. Abraham said most FOMAA member organisations have cancelled Onam events altogether. ,  ,  , \u201cThere will be light snacks to be followed by a video message from IAS officer Prasanth Nair who has been mobilising volunteers and support for rescue and relief through social media,\u201d said Vishakh Cherian, an IT professional based in Indiana, one of the organisers of the Chicago event. Mr. Cherian had built a community of nearly 90,000 people on Facebook for making his home city Thiruvananthapuram \u201cthe best\u201d. Even before the floods had spread across Kerala, Mr. Cherian started mobilising the community to help other parts of Kerala. \u201cDozens of other organisations in Thiruvananthapuram joined us. At least eight groups of volunteers travelled to Central Travancore region with materials in the initial days of the calamity, as they were prepared and Thiruvananthapuram was less affected. People from the U.S. and the U.K. supported it,\u201d said Mr. Cherian. , Starting this weekend, Onam events were planned for all weekends through September. \u201cA few have decided to go ahead with the plans, as the Onam event was the only source of income for them. Those who are going ahead with events have rebranded them as fundraising for Kerala,\u201d said Vinod John, a graphic artist and photographer in Mississauga, near Toronto. Mississauga Kerala Association is contributing 10% of the ticket sales to Kerala Chief Minister\u2019s relief fund, said president Prasad Nair, besides separate fund raising, he said. , Mr. John and Mr. Cherian said diaspora members hailing from less affected parts of Kerala or other States such as Tamil Nadu and Telangana were in a position to help victims. Groups in Mississauga could source supplies from Punalur, in Kollam district for relief camps in Aluva and Paravoor, in Ernakulam district, for instance.
