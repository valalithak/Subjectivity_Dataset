 [][][][The Goods and Services Tax, the country\u2019s biggest tax reform since Independence, will help speed up India\u2019s economy and prepare it to compete with top countries, BJP president Amit Shah said here on Saturday.
 Mr. Shah, who is on a two-day visit to Goa, said efforts made to malign the GST had failed. Whether in Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat or Assam, there will be a common tax structure, he said.
 Mr. Shah is in Goa to plan the strategy for the the 2019 general elections, strengthen the party\u2019s organisational structure and interact with industrialists, hoteliers, professionals and builders, said BJP sources.
 Soon after the Parliament session, Mr. Shah said the concept of \u201cone nation, one market, one tax\u201d had been fulfilled.][Please enter a valid email address.
