 \nThe Hindu\ncaught up with CSK\u2019s bowling coach L. Balaji, a key seamer for the side in its early years, for his views on the qualities that drive this popular Chennai outfit.
 The former India paceman said, \u201cTo start with, there have always been several match-winners in the side, with bat and ball.\u201d, Balaji elaborated, \u201cNow you have Dhoni, Raina, Bravo, Rayudu, Watson, Faf du Plessis, Harbhajan, Ngidi and any of them can win you the match. Previously, we had Hayden, Hussey and Muralitharan. Along with team effort, you have individual brilliance.\u201d, And then there are several leaders within the group. Balaji observed, \u201cThis has been CSK\u2019s hallmark. Apart from skipper Dhoni, you have du Plessis, Bravo, and Watson, all of whom will offer their views, take responsibility and guide the youngsters. Then you have Hussey [batting coach], who always shares his knowledge.\u201d, Dhoni, with his equanimity, enormous ability and leadership skills, has been such an influential figure. \u201cOff the field, he allows his players to chill without losing focus. On the field, he is a fantastic reader of the game and gets the best out of his men,\u201d Balaji said.
 \u201cA lot has been said on how he is able to finish games with the bat and he is so calm. But what has always struck me about Dhoni is his ability to make you relax mentally. Even when I bowled in the death overs, I don\u2019t remember Dhoni speaking to me much. He would just indicate subtly what he wanted, never put pressure on the bowlers. And his field placements were exceptional and innovative. He is an instinctive captain.\u201d, Like a family, CSK was more like a family under Dhoni, Balaji said.
 \u201cYou have to be in the side to experience this. There is harmony, the management backs the cricketers, the players are happy for each others\u2019 success and Dhoni treats every player equally and they are given the freedom to express themselves.\u201d, Asked to pick one quality that underlined CSK, Balaji replied, \u201cResilience. It\u2019s a tough side, doesn\u2019t accept defeat till the last ball, wins from impossible situations. CSK was out of IPL for two years and look at the way it has come back.\u201d][]
