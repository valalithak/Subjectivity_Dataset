 [][][\nSea of yellow:Even after its home matches were moved to Pune, CSK\u2019s loyal fansensured that the team never felt it was playing an away game.V. Ganesan\n\xa0 ][It\u2019s remarkable how Chennai Super Kings has grown over the last 11 years, cutting across barriers, connecting with its large army of fans, forming lasting bonds.
 What makes CSK tick the boxes? It\u2019s the franchise\u2019s separate identity, be it the iconic M.S. Dhoni, the colour yellow, the breathless \u2018whistle podu\u2019 dance, a train that transports its fans, and of course, its entertaining brand of cricket.
 Pan-India reach, The side not only has a pan-India reach, but boasts of a global presence now. The immensely popular team from Chennai has embraced fresh aficionados along the IPL highway.
 And its social media messaging \u2014 typified by the roaring lion \u2014 has played a huge part in bringing the CSK fans, from different countries, into a single platform.
 CSK has over 12 million followers on Facebook, beyond four million on Twitter and more than a million on Instagram.
 Even during its two-year absence from the IPL, social media played a key role in keeping the fan base intact.
 This has been a season when CSK\u2019s social media handles have been very busy. And the fans have responded with passionate posts.
 When Cauvery protests forced CSK to shift six of its home games to Pune, the fans unified to vent their anger and frustration.
 In fact, some posts have made their points forcefully such as the two pictures \u2014 presented together featuring Faf du Plessis.
 The South African holds the shoe thrown at him during the CSK-Kolkata Knight Riders game at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in one, while he celebrates after piloting the Chennai side to a thrilling victory in Qualifier-1 on the other.
 Then there are videos of CSK fans swinging to the rhythm of \u2018whistle podu\u2019 in places such as Singapore, Malaysia and the US, revealing the spread of the franchise.
 Good-natured humour, There are many posts laced with good-natured humour as well, such as those about N. Srinivasan, the boss at India Cements, the company that runs CSK.
 What stands out is the manner the franchise has used local pop culture and Tamil movies and songs to interact with the fans.
 Whether in Chennai or Pune or any another venue, a sea of yellow cheers its team on from the stands. Popular, CSK certainly is.
 The \u2018whistle podu\u2019 brigade is here to stay.][]
