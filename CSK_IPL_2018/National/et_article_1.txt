IPL 2018 couldn't have ended on a better note for Chennai Super Kings. Returning to the IPL pitch after a 2-year suspension, the team, led by MS Dhoni won not just hearts but also the trophy.

 And Amul captured the moment perfectly in their new cartoon featuring man of the match Shane Watson, and Ziva in dad Dhoni's arms.

 Watson led CSK to a win as scored a sensational 117 featuring eight fours and nine sixes. This was his second century in season 11, and the highest-ever score in an IPL final. The batsman closed the tournament with 555 runs.

 The team deafeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets.

 But if Watson stole the limelight during the match, it was Ziva Dhoni running towards her dad after the match that had everyone's hearts.

 The picture of the 3-year-old in Dhoni's arms made it not just all across social media but also to Amul's cartoon, where she was represented by the polka-dotted Amul girl.

 Showing another example of its creative wordplay, Amul titled the cartoon, 'Shane ai Super Kings', with the caption 'Yellow always wins!'
