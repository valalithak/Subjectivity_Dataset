Chennai Super Kings made the perfect comeback to the Indian Premier League fold after two years with their third IPL title, thanks largely to Shane Watson’s 117 off 57 deliveries that helped his team overcome the best bowling attack of the tournament - Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Mocked as a team of 30 plus cricketers, who would not be able to hang in with their younger counterparts, before the start of the season; the MS Dhoni-led team proved the naysayers wrong and what made it even more special was the fact that the 36-year-old Watson stepped up big time when it mattered the most.

After a horrid IPL 2017, where Watson scored only 71 runs in eight matches for Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Queensland-born allrounder reminded everyone why he was regarded as one of the best players of his generation. Watson scored 555 runs in 15 matches at an average of 39.64 this year. 

His 51-ball century in the final even shocked the skipper. 

After the win, Dhoni posted a picture on Instagram hailing Watson’s knock are a shocking innings, of course in a good way.

Here’s what Dhoni wrote with a picture of him with his wife and daughter posing with the IPL 2018 trophy. “Thanks everyone for the support and Mumbai for turning yellow.Shane ‘shocking’ Watson played a shocking innings to get us through.end of a good season.Ziva doesn’t care about the trophy, wants to run on the lawn according to her wordings."
