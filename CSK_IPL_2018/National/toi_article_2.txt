Pitch Report
"Interesting Surface. Looks a little tacky on top and dry underneath it. This surface is a little tacky, which is why they put water on it recently. I personally like a good total up on the board in a big final. That being said, I would put the opposition in to bat if I won the toss, because it is likely to do something first up. And if it seams around, it will spin too." -
