AIADMK cadres pray for Jayalalithaa’s recovery
 This morning, the members of the Mylapore unit of AIADMK’s women’s wing got together at Sri Kapali Temple to take out a ‘paal kudam’ procession, starting from here and walking to the Kolavizhiamman Temple for an ambishekam and prayers. There were some 50 women here.
They did this to pray for the recovery of AIADMK leader and state chief minister J. Jayalalithaa who is recovering in a city hospital now.
Later, some members of the political party, men and women joined this group for the abhishekam. They also sat down to partake of food served on the plain ground here – a ritual held to wish the party leader quick recovery.
