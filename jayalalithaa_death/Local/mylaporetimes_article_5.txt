Life as usual in Mylapore; status following news that Jayalalithaa is critical in hospital
 It is business as usual on the streets and roads of the Mylapore neighbourhood this Monday morning as the city woke up to the news that state chief minister Jayalalithaa, who has been unwell and begin treated at Apollo Hospital had suffered a cardiac arrest and was in a critical condition on Sunday evening.
Last night, as the news from Apollo spread across the city, there were no signs of unrest in the Mylapore area.
This morning, policemen and women of the Mylapore zone reported in full at places like Luz to be briefed on their role in the current situation.
But since morning, traffic was moving smoothly on the roads, schools functioned  and later, shops in the market places – mada streets in Mylapore, Luz Circle and Mandaveli – opened.
But in many zones, traffic was less than usual.
Petrol stations are also open.
