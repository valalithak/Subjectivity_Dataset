Mylapore peaceful as people pay tributes to Jayalalithaa
 The Mylapore neighbourhood remains quiet and peaceful since early morning following the death of chief minister J. Jayalalithaa.
Early in the morning, Jayalalithaa’s body was taken in a  van from her Poes Garden residence, off Kasturi Ranga Road to Rajaji Hall, where it has been kept for people to pay their respects.
Petrol stations, stores, pharmacies and restaurants are closed. Only a handful of hawkers were seen at local markets.
Buses and autos and taxis are off the road. But the MRTS train services are running.
Most offices in the area remain closed.
