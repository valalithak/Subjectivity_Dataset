 \u201cWe first came here two years ago to see the stadium. The work that has been done has been staggering. I am confident that the stadium will look 30 years younger. I grew up here, watched football here. It gives me immense pleasure to say Kolkata has been ratified as one of the venue for World Cup matches,\u201d Joy Bhattacharya, Project Director \u2014 FIFA U-17 World Cup, said.
 \u201cMassive amount of work has gone into the stadium, impressive improvements since our last inspection in February. Lot of work has been done, hence the ratification.

 State Sports Minister Aroop Biswas said 75 to 80 per cent work has been done and the stadium will be complete by January 31.
 When asked about the chances of Kolkata holding the final, Tournament Director, Javier Ceppi said, \u201cThis question keeps coming back and same thing I keep telling you. Before we can announce about final, we have to complete the work fully. We are extremely satisfied.\u201d, \u201cMonsoon has been severe here so has been summer. We understand the weather constraint after January, we will have an assessment, then we will see whether a final or a key match can be played here,\u201d he added.
 When asked whether they are happy with the security arrangements, Ceppi said, \u201cI have come to West Bengal 30 times. I have always felt very welcome and never felt threatened. We are working with the State government. We will try to deliver a friendly and a very good tournament.\u201d, Ceppi later said ratification doesn\u2019t mean a blank cheque as the progress of the work that is being done will be assessed periodically.
 Kochi, Mumbai, Guwahati, Delhi and Margao have already been ratified as venues following inspections by the FIFA delegation.][Please enter a valid email address.
