 In his first-ever congressional appearance, the Facebook founder and chief executive sought to quell the storm over privacy and security lapses at the social network that have angered lawmakers and Facebook's two billion users.
 Swapping his customary tee-shirt for a business suit and tie, Mr. Zuckerberg faced tough questions over how a U.S.-British political research firm, Cambridge Analytica, plundered detailed personal data on 87 million users to be used in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
 Facebook also became the platform of choice for a stunning Russian campaign of online misinformation that U.S. intelligence says was designed to tilt the 2016 vote toward Donald Trump.
 \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in prepared testimony. \u201cI started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,\u201d he said. \u201cThat goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\u201d, \n, \nFacebook wants to ensure protection of integrity of elections: Mark Zuckerberg , Lawmakers questioned whether the election meddling and poor controls on personal data requires the government to step in to regulate Facebook and other social media companies, which generate revenue from user data.
 \u201cThe tech industry has an obligation to respond to widespread and growing concerns over data privacy and security and to restore the public trust. The status quo no longer works,\u201d said Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of one of the committees holding the hearing.
 \u201cCongress must determine if and how we need to strengthen privacy standards to ensure transparency and understanding for the billions of consumers who utilize these products.\u201d, \u201cYou have a real opportunity this afternoon to lead industry and demonstrate a meaningful commitment to protecting individual privacy,\u201d Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein told Mr. Zuckerberg at the rare joint committee hearing, to be followed by a similar hearing in the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
 \n, \nZuckerberg\u2019s testimony at the hearing before Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees\n, Dozens of protestors gathered outside Congress before the hearing wearing Mr. Zuckerberg masks and #DeleteFacebook T-shirts.
 Inside the jammed hearing room, activists from the Code Pink group wore oversized glasses with the words \u201cSTOP SPYING\u201d written on the lenses, and waved signs that read \u201cStop corporate lying.\u201d, Testifying was a new step forward for the 33-year-old Mr. Zuckerberg, who started Facebook as a Harvard dropout in 2004, and built it into the world's largest social media company worth $470 billion.
 In the past, he has left it to top lieutenants to answer questions from legislators.
 But after the largest scandal yet for Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg has seen it as imperative to speak out himself and try to prevent the company from bogging down in questions about its core business model, which is to share user data with advertisers.
 The lawmakers delivered plenty of warnings that Mr. Zuckerberg needs to take action \u2014 though they were thin on concrete proposals.
 \u201cIf you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy anymore,\u201d said Senator Bill Nelson.
 Mr. Zuckerberg called Facebook \u201can idealistic and optimistic company\u201d and said, \u201cWe focused on all the good that connecting people can bring.\u201d, But he acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\u201d, Mr. Zuckerberg added, \u201cI want to be clear about what our priority is: protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profit.\u201d, He recounted a list of steps aimed at averting improper use of data by third parties like Cambridge Analytica, and noted that other applications were being investigated to determine if they did anything wrong.
 On Friday, Facebook sought to allay concerns over political manipulation of its platform by announcing support for the \u201cHonest Ads Act\u201d that requires election ad buyers to be identified, and to go further by verifying who sponsors ads on key public policy issues.
 Mr. Zuckerberg vowed to \u201chire thousands of more people\u201d to get the new system in place ahead of U.S. midterm elections in November, starting the process in the U.S. and taking it global in the coming months.][Please enter a valid email address.
