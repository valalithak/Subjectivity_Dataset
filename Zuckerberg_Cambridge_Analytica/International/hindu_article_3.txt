 Embroiled in a massive data breach following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook said data on about 87 million people \u2014 mostly in the US \u2014 may have been improperly shared with London-based political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
 Mr. Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook in 2004, once again admitted the lapses and asked for another chance to lead the company.
 \n, \nFacebook revamps privacy policy in heels of data breach scandal\n, \u201cGive me another chance,\u201d he told reporters during a conference call when asked if he is still the best person to lead the company.
 \u201cThis a huge mistake. It\u2019s my mistake,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, taking the blame for the massive data breach.
 \u201cYes. People make mistakes and learn along the way. I\u2019m the first to admit we didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of what our responsibilities are...What people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes,\u201d he said.
 He said he was unaware of the board asking him to step down against the backdrop of the data breach scandal.
 \u201cNot that I am aware of...Nobody has been fired because of this scandal,\u201d he said when asked if the board has asked him to step down in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
 \u201cI have not, due to the CA situation, yet. We\u2019re still working through this. At the end of the day, this is my responsibility. There have been a bunch of questions about that. I started this place, I run it, I\u2019m responsible for what happens here,\u201d he told reporters.
 \u201cI\u2019m not looking to throw anyone else under the bus for mistakes we made here,\u201d he said.
 \n, \nWhat is the E.U. law on data protection all about?\n, Mr. Zuckerberg said the scandal has not much dented into its business.
 \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any meaningful impact that we\u2019ve observed. But, look, it\u2019s not good ... It still speaks to people feeling like this was a massive breach of trust and that we have a lot of work to do to repair that,\u201d he said, seeking to downplay the crisis that followed the data breach.
 Responding to a question, Mr. Zuckerberg said it will take years for Facebook to fix the problem.
 \u201cIt will be a multi-year process to combat disinformation,\u201d he said, adding that this will be a \u201cnever-ending battle.\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019re making progress against these adversaries but they\u2019re very sophisticated. We can\u2019t expect to fully solve a problem like this,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.
 Mr. Zuckerberg, who co-founded the company in 2004, is scheduled to testify before a Congressional committee on data breach next week.
 \u201cThis hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online. We appreciate Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s willingness to testify before the committee, and we look forward to him answering our questions,\u201d said committee Chairman Congressman Greg Walden, and the Ranking Member Frank Pallone.][Please enter a valid email address.
