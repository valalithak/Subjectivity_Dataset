 We must say that is so adorable of him as a husband to keep such a beautiful memory with his wifey as his screensaver. Both Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have been making headlines for their impressive avatars during Cannes Film Festival. 

Apart from making an outstanding couple entry, Priyanka and Nick took away everyone’s attention with their romantic moments on the red carpet. From Nick holding an umbrella for Priyanka to feeding her pizzas at their hotel room’s gallery, he has proven to be a doting husband for PeeCee! We are looking forward to see more such adorable moments between this adorable couple!
