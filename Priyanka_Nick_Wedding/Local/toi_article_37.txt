Haldi and safa ceremonies
 Says a source, "The day dawned with a breakfast programme from 7 am to 11 am at Rizala, the restaurant inside Umaid Bhawan. Post that, it was time for the traditional haldi-chooda ceremony, which was slated to take place at 12.30 pm at the Mardana Hall at the venue. The theme was 'pink, orange and purple' for guests and the decor was beautiful - with traditional gendaphool (marigolds) all around. There was a lavish spread for lunch at the Rathod Hall." At 5.30 pm, it was time for the safa ceremony, which is a big part of Punjabi weddings.

'Priyanka looked stunning'
There has been huge buzz about what PeeCee would wear for her wedding. Adds the source, "Priyanka wore a Sabyasachi ensemble and she looked stunning. Designer Sabyasachi was also seen helping her with her ensemble before the function, so it was assumed that she wore his creation."

As per tradition, Nick arrived on a ghodi. Adds the source, "He then joined his bride as they both took a ride on an elephant around the premises of the palace and arrived at the main wedding area. The varmala (garland exchange) ceremony took place at 8.30 pm, followed by an elaborate dinner. There is to be an after-party, too, which is set to take place around midnight."
