Nick the pop icon wasn't far behind his leading lady when it came to making a statement. Nick looked suave in a white suit by Dior Men. He teamed up the suit with a silver encrusted shirt, a matching stole and blingy shoes. Nick surprised us with an interesting accessory - his ear cuffs, which we think will trend for sometime now.

While the looks have become a hit with the international media, some 'Nickyanka' fans can't digest the dramatised looks and for all those of you, here's a n update - the beautiful couple chose their respective outfits to go with the theme of this year's gala - 'Camp: Notes on Fashion, which is a reference to to Susan Sontagâ€™s famous 1964 essay, Notes on 'Camp,' which is all about love of the unnatural, of artifice and exaggeration.

And, if you are wondering why so much hype about the Met Gala, here's an explanation - The Met Gala, formally called the Costume Institute Gala and also known as the Met Ball, is an annual fundraising gala for the benefit of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York City. It marks the opening of the Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit.
