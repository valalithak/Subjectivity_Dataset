And so planning our wedding with an amalgamation of both was so so amazing. An important part of the pre wedding rituals for the girl in an Indian wedding is the Mehendi. Once again we made it our own and it was an afternoon that kicked off the celebrations in the way we both dreamed. @nickjonas A post shared by  Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Dec 1, 2018 at 7:31am PST
