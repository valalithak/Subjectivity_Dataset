Sophie Turner to take Joe Jonas’ last name after wedding?
Hours after setting the stage on fire at the Billboard Music Awards on Wednesday, Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner headed straight to a Las Vegas chapel to get hitched in a surprise wedding.

American DJ Diplo was the first to break the news on social media with a series of Instagram posts that had everything from the bride walking down the aisle to the couple exchanging vows and being pronounced as husband and wife.

Photos from the wild Vegas wedding saw the couple exchanging candy rings instead of gold wedding bands. Although it was a private affair, the two are reportedly set to have a formal wedding ceremony in Paris that will be attended by their close friends and family. 

Reports doing the rounds state that much like how Priyanka Chopra took on husband Nick Jonas’ last name, Sophie will also do the same. 

According to their marriage certificate obtained by TMZ, the ‘X-Men’ actress wishes to use the name Sophie Belinda Jonas.

However, the 23-year-old still uses “Turner” on her social media handles.

After dating for a while, Sophie and Joe decided to take their relationship to the next level and announced their engagement in October 2017.
