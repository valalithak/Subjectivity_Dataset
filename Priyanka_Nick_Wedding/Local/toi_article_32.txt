Priyanka Chopraâ€™s brotherâ€™s wedding called off? You will be shocked to know what people are saying!
When Priyanka Chopra flew down for her brother Siddharth Chopraâ€™s wedding with Ishita Kumar, we were all ready for some happy family pictures but things did not work out this time too. It is speculated that the wedding has been called off. 

Ishita had shared a picture about her surgery a few days ago to which Priyanka posted best wishes and also commented about being excited for the wedding. After deleting all her roka and bachelorette pictures, with her latest post, things seem fine for Ishita as far as her health is concerned but what caught our attention were a few comments from her friends. These comments tell a completely different story about the divaâ€™s brother.

While most of the comments tell her to close the old chapter and move on in life (we are guessing they are talking about the wedding), there are a few comments that talk negative about Siddharth Chopra. 

This is what her mother commented:




Another comment which is a direct hit on Siddharth Chopra:





Siddharth owns a pub-lounge in Pune and Priyanka was present at the launch too.

Siddharth was earlier engaged to his long-time girlfriend Kanika Mathur. They were dating each other for three years and got hitched in an intimate roka ceremony with Kanika in October 2014 and were all set to marry in Goa in February 2015. But the wedding was called off in December.




Another theory is that while Priyankaâ€™s husband Nick Jonas flew down for the roka ceremony earlier this year, he did not accompany her this time while the wedding was planned. Was Priyankaâ€™s Mumbai visit really about her brotherâ€™s wedding?
