Priyanka Chopra looked breathtaking in a white sequin wrap around gown with a plunging neckline, a thig-high slit and a white belt by Lebanese fashion designer, Zuhair Murad. The star finished off the look with long three-tiered luxe diamond necklaces by New York's famous Tiffany & Co and transparent heels.

PeeCee looked smashing and her metallic make-up with nude lips was absolutely on point.

Nick, who was voted the most stylish man in America last year, looked suave as usual in one of his signature suits - he opted for a blue and grey plaid suit just like his brothers. He accessorised the look with blue moccasins and a big dialed watch.

The duo rocked the red carpet like never before and posed for the paparazzi at length. They also couldn't keep their hands off each other, which says so much about their relationship.
