Priyanka Chopra’s brother Siddharth’s wedding postponed
Priyanka Chopra’s younger brother Siddharth Chopra’s wedding, which was to take place last weekend, has been postponed as his fiancée Ishita Kumar had to undergo an emergency surgery. Ishita had posted a few photos on Instagram after her surgery, stating that it was a painful experience and that she was glad it was over.
Talking to Bombay Times, Priyanka’s mother, Dr Madhu Chopra, said, “We are disappointed, but what can you do when a person is unwell? We wish Ishita a speedy recovery.” 
Priyanka, who came down to Mumbai a few days ago, caught up with friends Isha Ambani, Tamanna Dutt and Srishti Behl Arya. The actress has now returned to the US.
