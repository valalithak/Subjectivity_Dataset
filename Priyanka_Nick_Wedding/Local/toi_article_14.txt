Life came around full circle for the two, who made their first appearance as a married couple at the very same venue, where they first paired up to strut the iconic stairs together. In between photo calls, managing her dress and the mayhem at the event, the cute couple were clicked stealing kisses and glances at each other as they made their way into the venue. 

Sharing a photo of herself planting a peck on Nick’s lips, Priyanka said, “Sometimes u just have to sneak it in!! @nickjonas.”
