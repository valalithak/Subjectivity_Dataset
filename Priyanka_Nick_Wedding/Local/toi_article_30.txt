For the big day, Priyanka picked a custom-made Ralph Lauren wedding gown with a 75-foot long train and looked nothing less than royalty as she made her way down the aisle with her mother by her side. We all got a peek at mommy Madhu Chopra getting teary-eyed as she held hands and walked with her daughter to the altar. Speaking about the flood of emotions she had on the wedding day, mommy Chopra said that she broke into tears when she saw her daughter dressed as a bride and admitted that she had waited for this day all her life.

Much like the rest of us, Madhu said she was at a loss of words when she saw Priyanka in the elaborate white gown. “My baby looked like a princess” she was quoted saying. 






She also confessed that it was her who wanted an Indian wedding and Priyanka knew that and hence followed all the rituals to the T. Talking about the red lehenga, she said that her daughter looked her prettiest best in the simple yet classy ensemble.
