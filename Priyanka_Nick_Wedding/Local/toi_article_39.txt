Priyanka Chopra’s future sister-in-law received THIS before the wedding
Our desi girl Priyanka Chopra and American singer Nick Jonas tied the knot earlier in December. Fans are yet to recover from the grand festivities that unfolded during the Christian and Hindu wedding ceremonies, and pictures from the wedding still surface on social media every now and then. But it seems like Priyanka’s fans already have something else to look forward to. This time, it’s her brother Siddharth Chopra who is all set to enter the bond of holy matrimony next week in New Delhi, as per reports. 

In February, PeeCee had shared a picture of the Siddharth and his to be wife Ishita Kumar with the caption: “So proud of my baby brother. Ishita welcome to the family...you are so beautiful together...I wish you both the best for the future! Happy Roka!!”

And now, Ishita took to Instagram and shared picture-perfect moments from her bridal shower in London. The series of images also included a thoughtful kit and note by Priyanka and Nick that read: “Dear Ishita, just some fun things to welcome you. It’s a kit to be a bride. We love you.”
