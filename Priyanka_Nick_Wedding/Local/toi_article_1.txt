NEW PHOTOS of Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra wedding
The moment all of us were waiting for has finally arrived. The pictures of Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's grand wedding were finally unveiled on Instagram on Tuesday and the internet has not stopped buzzing since then. Here's a look at the Instagram posts that are going viral.

The duo had two weddings - a Christian wedding and an Indian wedding and now that the pictures are out, we can't take our eyes off the beautiful couple. 

For the Christian wedding, Priyanka donned a strapless column dress embellished with pearlescent sequins, overlaid with hand embroidered high neck coat with scalloped sleeves and satin covered buttons.

Nick looked suave in a Purple Label double breasted tuxedo with a piece of the bride's dress hand embroidered with the Urdu words 'My Jaan' (meaning My Life) at the interior lapel of the jacket, just over his heart. 

For the Indian wedding, Priyanka wore a custom made red Sabyasachi Mukherjee lehenga. Hand embroidered and hand-cut organza flowers. French knots in silk floss, delicate Siam red crystals and layer upon layer of thread work embroidery created this piece of couture. The beautiful actress finished off her look with rich Mughal jewellery crafter with uncut diamonds, emeralds and Japanese cultured pearls in 22 karat gold.

Nick looked handsome like never before in his hand-quilted silk sherwani - again a Sabyasachi creation. He completed the look with a hand embroidered chikan dupatta and a chanderi tissue safa. His rose cut kalgi and syndicate diamond necklace from the Sabyasachi Heritage Jewelry collection.
