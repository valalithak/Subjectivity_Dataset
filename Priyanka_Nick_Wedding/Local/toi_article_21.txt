The actress looked back at her journey in the world of glamour and said, "I think I realised what all it takes to actually look the way we do on magazine covers and the work we do."

The hottie also spilled the beans on how she maintains her beautiful skin. "The way that I take care of my skin is to make sure to moisturise every day," shared Priyanka. 

"I take off all my make-up before I go to bed, and it doesn't have to be really difficult. I think hydration is extremely important, drinking as much water as you can. That is truly the elixir of life," she added.
