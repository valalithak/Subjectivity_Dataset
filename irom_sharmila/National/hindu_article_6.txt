 [][][][An unusually complex situation has evolved in Imphal, soon after the star activist of the State, Irom Sharmila, broke her fast earlier in the week.
 With a section of the press reporting that Ms. Sharmila has nowhere to go, the confusion about her whereabouts spread thick and fast. Till Friday night Ms Sharmila \u2014 referred often as \u2018Iron Lady\u2019 \u2014 remains unsure about her next home, while the Red Cross Society and individuals connected to Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights have come forward to provide shelter. Offers galore received from individuals residing outside the State. However, her friends told The Hindu that Sharmila will stay in Nehru Hospital in Imphal till August 23.
 \u201cShe has a court hearing on August 23 and Sharmila wants to attend the hearing, being in hospital,\u201d said Nandini Thokchom, a close friend, who is with Ms. Sharmila. Ms. Thockchom, a human rights defender, said that they are also not too keen to remove Ms. Sharmila from hospital as she needs \u201ctwo-three weeks\u201d to make the transition from liquid to semi-solid to solid food. \u201cShe is responding well and started having mashed banana, oats and corn flex. We have to be careful so she does not catch an infection,\u201d Ms Thokchom said.
 While her friends sighed in relief following Ms. Sharmila\u2019s recovery, they are equally perplexed about the reluctance of the residents of Keishamthong colony in Imphal West to accommodate the Iron Lady soon after she got bail. \u201cWe do not know the reason behind their reluctance, while now they are keen to apologize,\u201d said Ms Thokchom.
 \nUG politics of Manipur\n, The reason perhaps is embedded in the fractured politics of Manipur. All the types put together, Manipur has more than 40 underground [UG] groups holding a partial sway over the State\u2019s civil society. Some of the UGs are not happy about Sharmila\u2019s decision to withdraw her fast.
 \u201cSince the UGs are powerful, so many of us \u2014 out of fear or empathy \u2014 reverberate what the UGs say and are not too keen to shelter her, antagonising the guerrillas,\u201d said a senior journalist who was following Ms Sharmila\u2019s struggle for many years. Another reason could be \u2014 the journalist said on condition of anonymity \u2014 Ms Sharmila\u2019s interest to head the Manipur State, \u201ca State that she has despised so long,\u201d the journalist said.
 \nArguments for and against Sharmila\n, Ms. Sharmila\u2019s friends provided a different narrative. They feel, Manipuri society is happy to have Irom Sharmila in hospital, while they continue with their usual chores.
 \u201cIt is shameful that the Manipuris have not mounted any big movement in recent times, while expecting Sharmila to continue with the fast as all weather conscience keeper. Sharmila is first a human being and then \u2018an Iron Lady,\u2019 the society needs to remember that,\u201d said another of her friends.
 Another section of the Manipuri society, however, blamed Ms Sharmila for her plight, which ostensibly has nothing to do with her super star status.
 Someone who has documented and wrote about Ms Sharmila over years said \u2014 again on condition of anonymity \u2014 that the Iron Lady has \u201crepelled\u201d the people of Manipur by issuing statements against her sympathisers.
 \u201cShe has questioned the integrity of the same human rights activists, even her brother, who were with her and even said that if she does not win the election it would indicate that the Manipuris do not want \u2018freedom\u2019 from the Draconian law,\u201d said a writer-activist who has documented Sharmila over years.
 The Sharmila-camp, however, is reluctant to accept these allegations.
 \u201cA woman is living in a solitary confinement for years, while the world outside has nearly forgotten her. If she says a thing or two against her friends or even relatives\u2026[is it] responsible journalism to pick those negligent words to mount an opinion against her,\u201d asked one of her friends, a journalist.
 \u201cA process of churning is going on, even Sharmila is trying to cope with it\u2026\u201d said Ms Thokchom as more question was asked on phone about her elusive boyfriend and political plans. \u201c\u2026let us provide her with some time and peace, everything will be clear,\u201d she signed off as Ms Thokchom\u2019s feisty friend prepares to spend another lonely night in the Imphal hospital.][Please enter a valid email address.
