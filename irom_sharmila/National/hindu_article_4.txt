 [][][\nIrom Sharmila\n\xa0 ][A fortnight after being granted bail, activist Irom Sharmila is on her way from hospital to \u201ca yoga [and] meditation centre.\u201d, Putting speculation to rest, Ms. Sharmila said in an e-mail interview to The Hindu that she found a place in the Langol foothills in Imphal and would shift there on Friday. \u201cIt is a nature cure centre, not a hospital as such,\u201d she said.
 \u201cOne can enrol and follow the routine set by the centre. But I am going to stay as an independent person, following my own routine. It will be for the first time that I will be stepping outside as a free person,\u201d she said.
 Ms. Sharmila, however, refused to accept that the residents of Imphal were not too keen on accommodating her for reasons related to the State\u2019s politics.
 \nFight against AFSPA\n, \u201cThere are lots of offers and requests [to host her] but I do not want to oblige anyone. I plan to visit other districts in my State in continuation of my struggle, to hold dialogues and understand issues better. After that, I will be moving to my own space where I shall be interacting with people in the pursuit of our common goal against AFSPA [Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act] and for justice, peace and understanding,\u201d the 44-year-old said.
 Ms. Sharmila withdrew her 16-year-long fast on August 9 and is expected to go on a tour to address public meetings in north, central and west India against imposition of the AFSPA. She said that rather than isolating her, the Manipur society had in fact welcomed her decision to withdraw the fast, and thus she was having \u201cthe busiest days\u201d of her life. \u201cI have been having interactions with young people every day in the hospital, five-seven in one time.. I am learning so much about what is happening, their angst for change, and, I see a hope that has strengthened my resolve,\u201d she said.
 \nBack to normal diet\n, \u201cI have been deprived of this for the past nearly 16 years and it is overwhelming to be a part of this change that we all yearn for. The distance between me and society is now clearing,\u201d she said, adding that she is fast returning to a normal diet. \u201cI am a vegetarian and do not take milk. I am enjoying all the food that Manipur offers, from fruits to vegetables. My supporters are taking turns to bring me home-made food and fruits from their gardens. I also take oats and cornflakes.\u201d, Asked if she has managed to communicate with her Goa-born British boyfriend Desmond Coutinho, Ms. Sharmila said he wrote to her on July 18, which she received on August 10.][Please enter a valid email address.
