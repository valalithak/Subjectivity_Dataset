Irom Sharmila, who called off her 16-year fast on Tuesday, had been force-fed through a nasal tube since 2000.


Doctors say she will have to take it slow, get her body used to the new regime and get her systems reintroduced to solid food.


“She might need to be kept on a liquid diet for the next few days as her body will not be able to immediately digest solid food. A person who has not eaten solid food for 16 years cannot start it suddenly and enjoy a full normal meal. She has to start slowly and gradually in small quantities,” said Atul Gogia, consultant, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, here. Dr. Gogia said: “Even after a fast for two days, you can’t digest too much. This then has to be gradual. Her body has to relearn the entire process of chewing and her body has to get used to digesting solid food.’’


Anil Arora, chairman, Department of Gastroenterology of the hospital, said: “After disuse for so long, the internal lining of the stomach and intestine experience atrophy and it will take several weeks before the gut brain can balance itself out in a manner where there is proper absorption of vitamins, nutrients and calories. Some patients can also have an allergic reaction to certain food, including whole grains.’’


Dr. Anil Bansal from the Delhi Medical Council said the return to normal diet has to monitored and assisted by a medical doctor.
