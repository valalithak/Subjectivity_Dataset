NEW DELHI — The Indian human rights activist Irom Sharmila, who has been on a hunger strike for nearly 14 years to protest a law that gives impunity to armed forces serving in the state of Manipur, was arrested Friday just two days after a court ordered her release from custody, said L. M. Khaute, a senior police official in Imphal, the capital of Manipur. “As a measure to safeguard her life and for her well-being, the state has taken the step to take her into custody,” Mr. Khaute said Friday after Ms. Sharmila resumed her hunger strike. He said that Ms. Sharmila was in judicial custody, and that the police would press charges against her in connection with her hunger strike under a section of the Indian Penal Code that criminalizes attempted suicide. Ms. Sharmila’s struggle began after she witnessed the armed forces killing civilians in her village near Imphal in November 2000 after an explosion there. She was imprisoned shortly after when she began her fast and prosecutors charged her with attempting suicide. On Tuesday, a court in Imphal ordered her release, stating a lack of evidence in the case against her. On Wednesday, she was released from the security wing of the hospital in Imphal where she had been force fed through a tube throughout her imprisonment. She promptly resumed her fast. Mr. Khaute said that Ms. Sharmila, 42, had been returned to the security wing of an Imphal hospital on Friday where her force-feeding would resume.
