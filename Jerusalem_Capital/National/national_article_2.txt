Trump calls out Clinton, Bush and Obama on Jerusalem

WASHINGTON, United States — US President Donald Trump rewound the video tape Friday to show how three predecessors — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — made promises on Jerusalem that they later backtracked on.

“I fulfilled my campaign promise – others didn’t!” he boasted on Twitter, posting a video montage of his predecessors to prove his point.

During their respective campaigns, both Clinton and Bush said they favored moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, then changed their mind once in office.
