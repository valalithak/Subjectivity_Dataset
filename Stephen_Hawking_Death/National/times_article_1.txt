Stephen Hawking dies aged 76

Professor Stephen Hawking, the groundbreaking physicist who overcame crippling disease to become a symbol of human endurance, has died aged 76 at his home in Cambridge.

Considered one of the world’s greatest scientists, Hawking’s intellect probed the very limits of human understanding, both in the vastness of space and in the bizarre sub-molecular world of quantum theory, which he said could predict what happens at the beginning and end of time.
