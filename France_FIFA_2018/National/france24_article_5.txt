As it happened: France beat Croatia 4-2 to take World Cup victory 

France took on Croatia in a much-anticipated World Cup final that saw a goal for each side in the first 30 minutes of play and an eventual 4-2 win for Les Bleus. See FRANCE 24's live blog below to revisit the key moments from the match.

France and Croatia went head-to-head in the World Cup final in Moscow, with Les Bleus seeking their second title in 20 years. Croatia was seeking their first-ever World Cup victory.

Both teams went into Sunday’s final with the same starting line-ups as for their semi-final wins, over Belgium for France and England for Croatia.

With a population of only 4 million, Croatia is the smallest country to reach a World Cup final since Uruguay back in 1950. Zlatko Dalic’s team were seeking revenge against France after losing 2-1 to Les Bleus in the 1998 semi-finals in Paris, where Dalic travelled to watch that World Cup as a fan. Croatia have never beaten France in six matches.

France coach Didier Deschamps is only the third person to win the trophy as both a player and manager. Striker Kylian Mbappé, whose two goals helped to send the Argentines home earlier in the tournament, is only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final – after Brazil legend Pele in 1958.
