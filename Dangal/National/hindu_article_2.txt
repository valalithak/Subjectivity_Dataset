 [][][\nAamir Khan has starred in a jaw-dropping string of hits. A still from \u2018Dangal\u2019.\n\xa0 ][, Aamir Khan\u2019s \u2018Dangal\u2019 has created an unrepresented landmark in China today by becoming the 33rd film in Chinese cinema history to cross one Billion RMB, which in Indian currency amounts to about \u20b91000 crore.
 According to Maoyan, a popular ticketing website in China which is connected to most of the theatres in the country, Dangal\u2019s gross earnings has crossed one billion RMB, joining the exclusive club of just 32 films in China cinema history.
 \u201cIt is an unprecedented success for an Indian film and important land mark, making \u2018Dangal\u2019 a super hit Indian film,\u201d Prasad Shetty, partner of Strategic Alliance a Chinese firm promoting Indian films in China for the past few years told PTI here.
 The film which became big hit since it was released on May 5 slipped to second place in the Chinese box office yesterday after staying on top for over a fortnight. Hollywood film \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean 5\u2019 is on the number one position.
 \u201cIt is still playing in about 9000 screens. Dangal\u2019s success in China perhaps opens a Pandora Box for Indian cinema as successes in China\u2019s Box Office means world\u2019s highest revenue,\u201d Mr. Shetty said.
 The film has also made Aamir, 52, the most popular Indian Chinese social media star with over 6.55 lakh followers. ][Please enter a valid email address.
