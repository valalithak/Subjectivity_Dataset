 [][][][In March this year, when Mariyappan Thangavelu cleared a distance of 1.78m in the men's high jump T42 event at the IPC Grand Prix in Tunisia, he comfortably achieved the A-Qualification Standard of 1.60 for the Rio Paralympics.
 At last year\u2019s World Championships in Doha, Sam Grewe\u2019s gold-medal-winning jump was measured at 1.81m, while Egypt\u2019s Hamada Hassan needed 1.78 to take the silver.
 It has given 20-year-old Mariyappan the belief that he has a real shot at a medal in Rio this September, should he go there. \u201cIt is not beyond me,\u201d he says. \u201cEven a gold is possible.\u201d, Until a couple of years ago, though, his outlook on life was a whole lot bleaker. Mariyappan was five when an accident in his village of Periavadagampatti, some 50km from Salem, left him with a permanent disability. Mariyappan was on his way to school when a bus swerved dangerously off the road and ran over his right leg, crushing it below the knee.
 \u201cI was told the driver was inebriated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. My right leg is now stunted \u2014 it is still a five-year-old\u2019s leg; it has never grown or healed.\u201d His mother, who now sells vegetables to make a living, took out a loan of Rs. 3 lakh for his medical treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re still paying it off,\u201d he says. \u201cLife is hard but we\u2019re somehow getting by.\u201d, Mariyappan liked volleyball, though, and played the sport in school despite his condition. His P.E. master asked him to try his hand at high jump, and in his first competitive event (against able-bodied athletes), aged 14, Mariyappan finished second. \u201cI didn\u2019t see myself as different from able-bodied kids,\u201d he says.
 \u201cAt first, my classmates didn't believe I could do it. But once I made that first jump, they were all excited. After that day, a lot of people came to support me whenever I competed in the district.\u201d Mariyappan points to his deformed right big toe \u2014 misshapen and noticeably large. \u201cThis is what gives me leverage when I jump,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is my God.\u201d, Mariyappan\u2019s coach, Satyanarayana, first spotted him at the National para-athletics championships of 2013 and two years later took him under his wing, bringing him to Bengaluru for training. \u201cRio is my immediate goal,\u201d Mariyappan says.
 \u201cAfter that, I want to find a good job and take care of my mother.\u201d, All his dreams, however, are incumbent on India being permitted to compete at the Paralympic Games, for the Paralympic Committee of India is currently suspended.
 "Currently the National Paralympic Committee of India has not secured any quota places for the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games in any event, because they are suspended," Craig Spence, Communications and Media Director of the International Paralympic Committee, told The Hindu via e-mail.
 \u201cShould the suspension be lifted, or an alternative found, then two athletes have achieved the A Qualification Standard in men\u2019s high jump T42 (Mariyappan and Varun Singh Bhati) to secure slots for their country.\u201d][Please enter a valid email address.
