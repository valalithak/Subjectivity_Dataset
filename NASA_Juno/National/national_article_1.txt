NASA spacecraft uncovers Jupiter's deepest secrets, so far

NASA's Juno probe reached Jupiter in July 2016, and scientists' view of the solar system has not been the same since.

The $1 billion mission has taken stunning images of the gas giant several hundred million miles from Earth.

More importantly, though, the tennis-court-size spacecraft has probed some of the planet's deepest, darkest secrets with a suite of high-tech instruments.
Scientists say they have detected water clouds deep inside the Jupiter's Great Red Spot.

Here are some of the most fascinating scientific discoveries made by Juno at Jupiter â€” and a taste of what's possibly to come, since the probe has several years of exploration left before NASA crashes it into the planet.
