They defeated hosts England and followed it with wins against West Indies, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In all the matches, Mithali has shown sublime form. She has so far scored 71, 46, 8, 53 and 0. The one match in which she failed to score runs was the one India lost against South Africa., Earlier, in the match against Australia, India were in a spot of bother after they lost Smriti Mandhana early in the innings but a sensible partnership between Punam Raut and Mithali Raj provided them with resistance as the two compiled a partnership of over 100 runs for the second wicket.]
