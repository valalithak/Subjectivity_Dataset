 [][][\nIndian women cricket captain Mithali Raj in action during a match in ICC Women\u2019s World Cup. \xa0 ][Indian captain Mithali Raj is just 41 runs away from becoming the first woman cricketer to score 6,000 runs in ODIs, a feat she may accomplish in the upcoming match against South Africa. She is now second only to Charlotte Edwards in the women top-scorers in ODI list, and her average is way ahead of Edwards'.
 Mithali Raj has played 181 ODIs, scoring 5,959 runs at an average of 51.81. She has so far scored five centuries, her highest being 114 not out. She has also taken eight wickets with her part-time leg-break bowling, with 3-for-4 being her best numbers.

She has also played 63 T20 Internationals, scoring 1,708 runs at an average of 37.95 with a highest of 73 not out.
 Mithali Raj has often been called the \u201cSachin Tendulkar of Indian women\u2019s cricket\u201d having made her ODI debut at the age of 16. Her unbeaten 114 in that match against Ireland paved way for an Indian victory.
 However, comparisons with male cricketers may not go down well with Mithali Raj. While speaking to Cricinfo just before departing for the ICC Women's World Cup, she was asked about her favourite male cricketer. "Do you ask the same question to a male cricketer? Do you ask them who their favourite female cricketer is?\u201d she responded. \u201cI have always been asked who's your favourite cricketer, but you should ask them who their favourite female cricketer is.\u201d][Please enter a valid email address.
