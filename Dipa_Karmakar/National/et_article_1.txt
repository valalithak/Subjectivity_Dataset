Dipa Karmakar wins gold in Gymnastics World Cup
Returning to action after a long lay-off of nearly two years due to injury, India's premier gymnast Dipa Karmakar clinched the gold medal in the vault event of FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Challenge Cup at Mersin, Turkey today.

The 24-year-old from Tripura, who had finished fourth in vault event in the 2016 Rio Olympics, scored 14.150 to win gold today. She had topped the qualification also with a score of 13.400.

This is Dipa's first medal in a World Challenge Cup.

Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi
congratulated
Dipa Karmakar for winning the 
gold
medal.

"India is proud of @DipaKarmakar! Congratulations to her 
on winning a well-deserved 
Gold in the vault event at the FIG World Challenge Cup in Mersin, Turkey. This win is a prime example of her tenacity and never-say-die attitude," 
PM
Modi wrote 
on his official Twitter handle.

Dipa, who is being accompanied by her coach Bisheshwar Nandi, has also qualified in balance beam finals by finishing third in the qualification with a score of 11.850.

Dipa had suffered an Anetrior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury after Rio Olympics and had undergone surgery. She was initially confident of making a comeback at the Commonwealth Games but rehabilitation took more time than expected and she missed the Gold Coast event.

She has been included in the 10-member Indian gymnastics team for the upcoming Asian Games.
