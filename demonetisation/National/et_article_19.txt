Ban on 500, 1,000 notes to help curb corruption: SIT chief on black money
NEW DELHI: The chairman of the special investigation team (SIT) on black money, Justice M B Shah, has fully endorsed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's move to demonetise the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. It will “certainly help in curbing corruption and unaccounted for wealth“, he added.

“I fully appreciate the step taken by the government to demonetise high-value currency notes. It will control the generation of unaccounted for wealth and stop the transfer of illegal funds,“ Justice Shah told TOI. “The corrupt will have no way out but to declare their ill-gotten money. It will not be easy for unscrupulous elements to hide their illgotten wealth,“ he said.

“The move will go a long way to help curb the overwhelming influence of black money in several sectors of the economy,“ he added. The SIT, also comprises Justice Arijit Pasayat as deputy chairman, had suggested to the Supreme Court that no person be permitted to hold more than Rs 10-15 lakh in cash to help curb black money. “We had made this suggestion keeping in mind the fact that many hospitals and emergency services still do not accept cheques,“ Shah explained.

The Supreme Court had set up the SIT in 2011 on a petition filed by noted advocate Ram Jethmalani. The Modi government notified the SIT headed by Justice Shah and assisted by Justice Pasayat on its first day in office on May 28, 2014.

Asked whether the move would affect the common man, Justice Shah said, “...This move will help improve the economy and the real beneficiary will be the common man.“ Justice Pasayat agreed. “Only those who hold unaccounted for money for illegal purposes would be affected“.
