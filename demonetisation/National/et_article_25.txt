Demonetisation of Rs 500, Rs 1,000: Housewives to face less scrutiny
NEW DELHI: Housewives could soon see their bank accounts swell as they are unlikely to face scrutiny if extra household cash or piggy bank savings in high-denomination notes are deposited in them, but those depositing large cash in excess of matching income as per tax returns will be in trouble.  Small businessmen, housewives, artisans, and workers will also have similar relief.  “Such group of people as mentioned… need not worry about such small amount of deposits up to Rs 1.5 or Rs 2 lakh, since it would be below the taxable income,” revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia said in a set of questions released by the finance ministry. “There will be no harassment by I-T department for such small deposits made.”  The department would be getting reports of all cash deposited during the period of November 10 to December 30, 2016, above a threshold of Rs 2.5 lakh in every account.           “The department would do matching of this with income returns filled by the depositors. And suitable action may follow,” Adhia said. If the department finds large cash deposits that are in excess of income, it will take action.  “This would be treated as the case of tax evasion and the tax amount plus a penalty of 200% of the tax payable would be levied as per the section 270(A) of the Income-Tax Act,” Adhia said.  Under the current rules, banks have to already report cash deposits aggregating Rs 10 lakh or more in a financial year in one or more accounts of a person.  The income-tax department will also look at jewellery purchases to see money laundered. “Action will be taken against those jewellers who fail to take PAN numbers from buyers. When cash deposits of the jewellers would be scrutinised against the sales made, whether they have taken the PAN number of the buyer or not will also be checked,” Adhia said.  In case of farmers too, since agricultural income is exempt, they can freely deposit cash in their account, but again deposits cannot exceed their likely income. “Since farmers’ genuine income is not taxable, the farmers should not worry at all in depositing the old currency notes in their account, Adhia tweeted.
