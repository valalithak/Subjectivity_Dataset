 Mr. Das warned people not to fall prey to rumours being spread through social media.'We have enough stock of salts and there is no reason for a temporary surge in price or shortage. Supply of essential commodities is being closely monitored. There are a lot of stories spreading through social media, like reports of certain institutions going on strike. There is no such thing, please don't believe such reports.'', \nDesperate attempt: Mamata\n, \n&gt;West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee says, ''This is a desperate attempt to start a 'black mechanism' with indelible ink.
