Though, the latest RBI data shows that currency in circulation had risen to \u20b919.6 lakh crore as of October 26, 2018, a 9.5% increase from two years ago.
 \u201cIndia was a cash-dominated economy,\u201d Mr Jaitley said in a written statement. \u201cCash involves anonymity in transactions. It bypasses the banking system and enables its possessors to evade tax. Demonetisation compelled holders of cash to deposit the same in the banks. The enormity of cash deposited and identified with the owner resulted in suspected 17.42 lakh account-holders from whom the response has been received online through non-invasive method.\u201d, \n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nScars of demonetisation more visible with time: Manmohan Singh\n\n\n\n\n, \nScars of demonetisation more visible with time: Manmohan Singh\n, This increased push towards digitisation achieved significant success, the Finance Minister said.
