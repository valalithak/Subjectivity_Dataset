I support and applaud Modiâ€™s black money move: Narayana Murthy
In a chat with ET Now, Narayana Murthy, Founder, Infosys, says Modi has always been opposed to corruption and black money and the step is a right one. Edited excerpts  You have been a big votary of clean money, you have been a big votary of the crackdown against corruption and against black money. Does the ban on the Rs 500 and Rs 500 notes a step to clean up the Indian economy impress you?  The Prime Minister has always been a big votary of fighting corruption and therefore the current move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 note is an excellent idea and I am glad the government has done that because we have to fight corruption if we have to make decent economic progress. So I am all with that decision and I applaud that.  But are you also impressed with the timing of the decision? It comes after the income disclosure scheme was closed and it comes just before the GST which is again a step in the direction to clean up the economy?  Fighting corruption is always a very important, very useful initiative and therefore I am happy that the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister they have decided to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes and they have given several ways whereby genuine people can indeed go back to banks, go back to RBI, and get their notes exchanged. The honest people will indeed be fully supported but the dishonest will have to suffer absolutely that is the right thing.
