Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes banned: Your questions answered by the RBI
Why this scheme?  The incidence of fake Indian currency notes in higher denomination has increased. For ordinary persons, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes, even though no security feature has been copied. The fake notes are used for anti-national and illegal activities. High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money. India remains a cash based economy hence the circulation of Fake Indian Currency Notes continues to be a menace. In order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money, the scheme to withdraw has been introduced.  What is this scheme?  The legal tender character of the notes in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs1000 stands withdrawn. In consequence thereof withdrawn old high denomination (OHD) notes cannot be used for transacting business and/or store of value for future usage. The OHD notes can be exchanged for value at any of the 19 offices of the Reserve Bank of India or at any of the bank branches or at any Head Post Office or Sub-Post Office.  How much value will I get?  You will get value for the entire volume of notes tendered at the bank branches / RBI offices.  Can I get all in cash?  No. You will get upto Rs 4000 per person in cash irrespective of the size of tender and anything over and above that will be receivable by way of credit to bank account.  Why I cannot get the entire amount in cash when I have surrendered everything in cash?  The Scheme of withdrawal of old high denomination(OHD) notes does not provide for it, given its objectives.  Rs 4000 cash is insufficient for my need. What to do?  You can use balances in bank accounts to pay for other requirements by cheque or through electronic means of payments such as Internet banking, mobile wallets, IMPS, credit/debit cards etc.  Also Read:  Black is the new white: Secondary real estate transactions to become transparent  What if I don't have any bank account?
