Online shopping may get costlier, thanks to Maharashtra plastic ban
Maharashtra government has banned the use of plastic in the state and this may make your online shopping expensive. Due to plastic ban, the e-commerce industry has started using corrugated box particles and paper softeners to package products shipped inside and outside Maharashtra, which may lead to rise in packaging cost and ultimately delivery cost. 

Besides, some sellers have increased the thickness of cardboard boxes, which is costlier than plastic packing. As a result of this, e-commerce companies are planning to pass on the extra cost to buyers. Paper packing costs higher than plastic and thermacoal packing by as much as 50 to 70 per cent.

E-commerce firms say that their cost of packaging shipments has increased by nearly 75 per cent and the extra cost will ultimately have to be borne by the consumers. According to industry, the price of one cardboard box ranges from Rs 8-13.

 E-commerce firms, which depend heavily on plastic packaging, are yet to figure out an alternative to plastic for wrapping their products.

The Maharshtra government had issued a notification on March 23 this year for imposing a ban on purchase, sale, distribution and storage of single use disposal plastic. The government has given an extension of three months to implement the ban.
