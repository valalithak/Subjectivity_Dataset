Plastic ban in Maharashtra comes into effect from today
The ban on plastic will come into effect from today across the state of Maharashtra. The state government, in a notification on March 23, had clamped down on the use of plastic in a bid to fight pollution caused due to its extensive use.

The notification banned manufacturing, use, sale, distribution and storage of plastic materials such as bags, spoons, plates and other disposable items. The ban also includes packaging material and thermocol. However, plastic used for packaging of medicines and drugs, milk and handling of solid waste is exempted from the ban. 

The government had given a three-month window to get rid of the existing stock.

"We will ensure that common people and small traders are not harassed. But strict action will be taken again plastic manufacturers (if they break the law)," PTI quoted environment minister Ramdas Kadam as saying.


PenaltyFor first time offenders the fine will be Rs 5,000. For second time offenders, the fine will be Rs 10,000. Those who violate it for the third time will face a fine of Rs 25,000 along with imprisonment of three months. 

"Anybody caught bringing in banned plastic goods will be imprisoned for three months," Kadam said.

The government has given an extension of three months to retail packaging companies for submitting their recycling plans. 


Who will implement the banMaharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) will enforce the ban on plastic. In Mumbai, the BMC has constituted a team to monitor the ban. The district and local authorities will also see that the ban is implemented.


Exemption for thermocolThe use of thermocol for decoration during the Ganesh festival may be permitted if the Mandals give an undertaking that the waste will later be handed over to Municipal Corporation for proper disposal, PTI quoted Kadam as saying.

The empowered committee which is dealing with the ban will take a decision in this regard, he added.
