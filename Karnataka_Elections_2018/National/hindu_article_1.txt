The BJP's B.S. Yeddyurappa took oath as the Chief Minister of Karnataka on Thursday. This follows a rare all-night hearing by the Supreme Court, when it refused to stay or postpone the swearing-in. A late-night petition filed by the Congress-JD(S) challenged Governor Vajubhai Vala's decision to invite the BJP to form a government.Here are the live updates:8.10 p.m. Karnataka Governor decision has led to MLAs’ auction: SinhaKarnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala inviting the BJP to form the government in the State has led to a situation wherein MLAs will be auctioned under the “Indian Political League” the way cricketers are auctioned in the Indian Premier League, former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha has said.Mr. Sinha staged a protest outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 17 against the Governor’s decision, and alleged that the unconstitutional move amounted to murder of democracy.The former Union Minister was also not impressed with the Congress and the JD(S) approaching the Supreme Court against Mr. Vala’s decision to invite the BJP to form government and noted it was the weakness of the country’s political system that it failed in delivering justice in such cases.Earlier in the day, Mr. Sinha has tweeted that the developments in Karnataka were rehearsal of what would happen in Delhi after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.“The BJP is eight MLAs short of majority. Now from where will it get the requisite numbers (to prove majority)? The numbers will be managed after some MLAs will defect from other parties,” Sinha said as he sat on a dharna on behalf of the Rashtriya Manch, “an apolitical forum” that Mr. Sinha formed on January 30 to highlight the alleged "anti-people" policies of the Centre. “The Governor has done exactly opposite of what is expected from him under the Constitution. Like there is Indian Premier League in cricket, the Governor’s decision has led to Indian Political League in which MLAs will be auctioned...it is murder of democracy,” Mr. Sinha added.Hitting out at Mr. Vala, who had been a BJP leader, Mr. Sinha said democracy would not work if Governors start acting as soldiers of parties. On May 16 too, the former Union minister warned that the BJP would brazenly try to subvert democracy if it failed to get majority in the general elections and added he was glad to have left the party. “I am glad I have left the party which is so brazenly trying to subvert democracy in Karnataka. It will do the same if it fails to get majority in the Lok Sabha election next year. Please note my warning,” he tweeted.Mr. Sinha quit the BJP on April 21.7.45 p.m.Major reshuffle in Karnataka bureacracy Hours after Mr. Yeddyurappa assumed office as Chief Minister, several IAS and IPS officers have been transferred in a top level reshuffle.The government appointed M.

The BJP’s irrational insistence that it will form a Govt. in Karnataka, even though it clearly doesn’t have the numbers, is to make a mockery of our Constitution. This morning, while the BJP celebrates its hollow victory, India will mourn the defeat of democracy.— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) May 17, 2018



BJP president Amit Shah, who did not attend the swearing-in ceremony, responds to Mr. Gandhi's tweet, saying: "The ‘Murder of Democracy’ happens the minute a desperate Congress made an ‘opportunist’ offer to the JD(S)."


President of the Congress obviously doesn’t remember the glorious history of his party.The legacy of Mr. Rahul Gandhi’s Party is the horrific Emergency, blatant misuse of Article 356, subverting the courts, media and civil society.— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) May 17, 2018

Who has the people’s mandate in Karnataka?The BJP, which has won 104 seats. OrCongress which dropped to 78 seats, whose own CM and Ministers lost by big margins. JD(S) who won only 37 seats and lost their deposits on several others. People are wise to realise.— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) May 17, 2018

The ‘Murder of Democracy’ happens the minute a desperate Congress made an ‘opportunist’ offer to the JD(S), not for Karnataka’s welfare but for their petty political gains. Shameful!— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) May 17, 2018
