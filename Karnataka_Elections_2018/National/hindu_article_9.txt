 \n, \nKarnataka Assembly elections: instances of \u2018cash for votes\u2019 reported from many constituencies\n, Various exit polls that came out after polling closed at 6 p.m. predicted a cliffhanger, with the ruling Congress and the BJP running neck-and-neck and the JD(S) in the third place, with the potential to be the king-maker.

 Voting was held in 222 out of the 224 seats, with polling in two constituencies put off \u2014 in Jayanagar due to the death of a candidate and in Rajarajeshwari Nagar due to alleged electoral malpractice. Over 2,622 candidates are in the fray, including 217 women. Counting will take place on May 15. A party must cross the halfway mark of 112 to wrest power.
