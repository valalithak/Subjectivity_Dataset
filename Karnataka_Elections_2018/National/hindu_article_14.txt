 He accused the State\u2019s Congress government, which he claimed was steeped in corruption, of thwarting the Centre\u2019s efforts for development.
 Hitting out at the Congress president, Mr. Modi also said those currently leading the party had \u201cno understanding\u201d of history and the country\u2019s legacy.
 \u201cI dare the Congress president to speak in Hindi, English or the mother tongue of his mother to deliver a speech in Karnataka for 15 minutes, without reading out from a piece of paper, on the achievements of the party government... people of Karnataka will draw their own conclusion,\u201d he told an election rally in Santemaranahalli.
 Mr. Modi also attacked the Congress for indulging in "family politics" by allowing a party's leaders kith and kin to contest in the Assembly elections.\xa0, "For the Chief Minister (Siddaramaiah) the rule is '2+1', where he will contest from two seats and has given his old seat (Varuna in Mysuru district) to his son (Yathindra) and for the other ministers (in the state cabinet), the rule seems to be '1+1', allowing their relatives to fight polls."\xa0, Fearing defeat, Mr. Siddaramaiah was changing his Assembly constituencies and contesting from two seats, Mr. Modi alleged.\xa0, Mr. Siddaramaiah has filed nominations for the May 12 election from Chamundeshwari in Mysuru district and Badami in Bagalkot district, while his son Yathindra is contesting from Varuna in Mysuru district.\xa0, Though Mr. Siddaramaiah had won from Varuna twice since the 2008 Assembly elections, he shifted to Chamundeshwari, making way for his son Yathindra to contest from his home constituency.\xa0, "For the Congress, it has always been about family politics. But for us (BJP), it is about people's politics. People of the state will decide which kind of politics they will choose (in the upcoming election)," Modi said.\xa0, \n, \nRahul seeks to turn the tables on the BJP\n, Mr. Modi was responding to Mr. Gandhi\u2019s dare to allow him to speak for 15 minutes in Parliament on various issues, including corruption, and that the Prime Minister will not be able to sit for 15 minutes.
 \u201cHis speaking for 15 minutes will itself is a big thing. And when I hear that I would not be able to sit, I think... wow, what a scene it is? Congress president, Sir, we cannot sit before you. You are \u2018naamdar\u2019 [famous], while I am \u2019kaamdar\u2019 [ordinary worker]. We have no status to sit in front of you,\u201d he said.
 Addressing the first of the 15 election rallies he is scheduled to address over the next few days, Mr. Modi claimed, \u201cA storm, and not a simple wave,\u201d was blowing in the BJP\u2019s favour in the State.
 Greeting the workers on the occasion of \u201cMay Day\u201d, Mr. Modi also took a dig at Mr. Gandhi for not acknowledging the contribution of workers towards 100% electrification of villages achieved under his government.
 \u201cApril 28th is a day that will be written in golden letters in country\u2019s history, because our hardworking people made electricity reach the last unelectrified village Leisang in Manipur.
 \u201cBut the new leader of the Congress did not utter two words of praise for the workers who made it possible,\u201d Mr. Modi said.][Please enter a valid email address.
