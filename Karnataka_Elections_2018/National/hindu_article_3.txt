 [][][\nCounsel for Congress-JD(S) Abhishek Singhvi arrives at the Supreme Court early on May 17, 2018. \xa0 | Photo Credit: Shiv Kumar Pushpakar ][Amid intense jockeying for power and allegations of horse-trading, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala on May 16 invited the BJP\u2019s B.S. Yeddyurappa to form the government in the State, prompting the Congress to move the Supreme Court. The court has said that it will not stay the swearing-in, but will make it subject to the outcome of the case.
  , Earlier on Wednesday, the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress combine and the BJP submitted the list of MLAs supporting them. The JD(S) and the BJP have also completed the process of electing the leaders of their respective Legislature Parties. The day also saw the JD(S) accusing the BJP of indulging in horse-trading, which the latter dismissed as imagination.
 Karnataka returned a hung Assembly on May 15 with the BJP winning in 104 seats, Congress 78 and the JD(S) 37, from the 222 constituencies that went to the polls. In a dramatic turn of events, the Congress offered support to the JD(S), which was duly accepted by party leader H.D. Kumaraswamy.
 5.31 a.m.
 The Supreme Court says that Mr. Yeddyurappa's swearing-in as Chief Minister of Karnataka today will not be stayed. But it will be "subject to outcome of petition here or further orders.", The SC also asks the Attorney-General to produce the May 15 and May 16 letters given to the Governor by Mr. Yeddyurappa\xa0 staking his claim to form the government. The case will now be taken up at 10.30 a.m. on Friday.
 \n, 4.56 a.m.
 "It stands to reason that we cannot injunct a party [the Governor] we cannot summon here," says Justice Bobde. "You cannot injunct a party you cannot issue notice to. Injunction is always against a person. You can but stay his order.", "If a Governor dared to make a one-man party CM, we cannot injunct the CM from taking oath.\xa0 But we can stay his government from functioning," says Justice Bobde, 4.50 a.m.
 "In Goa, Digambar Kamat of Congress never made a claim. Manohar Parrikar of BJP made his claim and was invited to form the government," says Mr. Rohatgi.
 Mr. Rohatgi again questions the urgency of the hearing. "In Yakub Memon, I argued from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m because the man was going to be hanged at 6 a.m. Here what is the urgency? The question of 15 days for the floor test can be decided in the next 2 or 3 days.", To this Anoop Chaudhary responds, "Here Constitution is going to be hanged.", 4.27 a.m.
 Before the Bench was to dictate the order, Mr. Singhvi sought to argue the matter further.
 Balance of convenience and majesty of law supports postponement of\xa0 swearing in, says Mr. Singhvi. "What if Yeddyurappa's letter shows he has no majority? My Lords can have the swearing-in in the evening.", To this Mr. Rohatgi says allow the swearing in and then "unscramble the egg".
 4.21 a.m.
 Indicating the order of the three-judge Supreme court Bench, Justice Sikri says it will not restrain the swearing in of B.S. Yeddyurappa, but will make it subject to the outcome of the case before it. It will issue notice to the BJP and give them one or two days to respond.
 \xa0, Mr. Rohatgi begins argument. While submitting that the Court can reduce time period from 15 to 10 or 7 days for the BJP to prove majority, he asks the Bench to dismiss the petition right away as it\u2019s misconceived.
 "The attempt is to injunct the Governor from inviting and administering oath. They are asking this court to restrain the Governor from doing his constitutional duties. You will end up injuncting Article 361 (1)," he says.
 "Congress, JD(S) wants to stultify a democratic process. By injuncting the Governor they are trying to efface the Governor," he adds.
 Justice Bodbe notes, "It is like a Bill is passed by both Houses and a petition is filed here to injunct the President from signing it.", Our Legal Correspondent reports:, Justice Sikri asks AG: \u201c117 members have signed on the Congress-JD(S) side. In that case, how can the BJP claim 113 (the simple majority) then?, To this Mr. Rohatgi comes back to his objection to the hearing itself. \u201cWhether floor test should be conducted in 10 or 15 days can be decided tomorrow and not at 4 a.m. in the morning,\u201d he says.
 And in the courtroom everyone discovers that Mr. Yeddyurappa, who is respondent 3, is not represented.
 PTI adds:, The Bench observes: \u201cIt is preposterous to argue before MLAs take oath they are not amenable to anti-defection law and it means open invitation to horse-trading.\u201d, To this the AG says the swearing-in is subject to outcome of floor test and the Court can hear the matter after that.
 \xa0, Mr. Venugopal tells the Bench nothing here is irreversible. \u201cEverything is reversible. What is the great loss by waiting for 15 days,\u201dhe asks.\xa0, Justice Bobde counters saying, \u201cThat is the other point. Why wait for 15 days?\u201d, To this the AG says it was the Governor\u2019s decision, adding that it\u2019s an area of darkness how Mr. Yeddyurappa is claiming to form the government. \u201cBut let the swearing-in go on. This is a purely reversible situation.\u201d, Our Legal Correspondent reports:, During his intervention AG Mr. Venugopal says \u201cEverything here is in the realm of speculation. Whole thing is a grey area.\u201d, Mr. Rohatgi asks the Bench \u201cWhat is the urgency of the matter to hear it at midnight? Will heavens fall if a person is sworn in in the morning\u201d, To this, Justice Sikri tells him to submit before the Bench how his side is claiming a majority in numbers.
 PTI reports:, The Bench asks Mr. Singhvi to wind up his arguments as he has already argued for more than an hour. Mr. Singhvi seeks a few more minutes.
 Our Legal Correspondent reports:, \u201cIt\u2019s apex of democracy if the Supreme Court can open up at 2 a.m. to provide justice,\u201d Mr. Singhvi says while concluding his arguments.
 \xa0, Our Legal Correspondent reports:, Mr. Singhvi counters the Bench\u2019s query saying, \u201cIf President\u2019s rule under Article 356 can be stayed by a court, why not this (decision) in which a Governor has exercised his discretion without the aid and advice of the Cabinet?\u201d\xa0, Mr. Singhvi adds that the Governor is not personally liable, but his exercise of gubernatorial duties are judicially reviewable.
 He asks the Bench to defer the swearing-in. \u201cIt is not like restraining the Governor, who only acted in pursuance of the BJP letter. Act of swearing-in is less than they make it out to be,\u201d he submits.
 PTI reports:, Mr. Singhvi says under Constitution immunity is given to Governor only for discharge of duties.
 Our Legal Correspondent reports:, The argument now moves to the Court's power to review a Governor's decision. Mr. Singhvi says the Court can judicially review Governor's discretion. To this, Justice Bobde responds saying the BJP MLAs\u2019 counsel\u2019s problem is not judicial review but that the Court cannot pass an injunction on the Governor\u2019s order.\xa0, Justice Sikri intervenes: \u201cHow can we interfere in this matter when you do not have even the letter you claim they wrote to the Governor?\u201d, PTI adds:, \u201cWe are wondering whether SC can restrain Governor that might lead to constitutional vacuum in State,\u201d the Bench observes. \u201cGeneral trend of past SC judgement is not to issue injunction to Governor or to restrain Governor.\u201d, Our Legal Correspondent reports:, The Bommai and the Rameshwar Prasad verdicts were based on different issues, but had commonly approved the Sarkaria Commission, argues JD(S)-Congress counsel Mr. Singhvi.
 \u201cKarnataka is the case of Goa in reverse,\u201d he says.\xa0\xa0, PTI adds: \u201cWho is in charge today in Karnataka,\u201d Bench asks. \u201cA caretaker government,\u201d responds Mr. Singhvi.
 Our Correspondent reports:, Mr. Singhvi argues that the BJP cannot form government as I (JD(S) and Congress) have the support of other parties. \u201cEC certificate shows 104 MLAs for BJP, unless someone from Congress has defected that is impermissible and prohibited.\u201d, He adds that it was impossible for BJP to move ahead from 104... when Justice Bobde intervenes saying: \u201cYou are talking about static loyalties. To this Mr. Singhvi responds: \u201cDynamic and moving loyalties also apply in this case.\u201d, Justice Bobde asks: \u201cShould the Court even consider restraining the Governor?\u201d, Singhvi says: \u201cWhat was the hurry for the Governor to swear in Yeddyurappa? They want to put this Court in a quandry. They want to give the impression that Court cannot injunct before swearing-in. And it is fait accompli after swearing-in.\u201d, Our Correspondent reports \u2014 Mr. Singhvi argues: \u201cThere is only one way a party which got 104 will get 113... I heard he asked for 7 days, but Governor gave 15 days. Elementary common sense and arithmetic against this kind of giving of time.\u201d, Mr. Singhvi adds: \u201cIn Jharkhand in 2005, Goa in 2017 and in the Jagadambika Pal case in U.P.
 the Court advanced the date of floor test from seven days to 48 hours.\u201d, PTI adds: \u201cIt is biggest license to poaching if Governor gives 15 days to BJP to prove majority; in earlier such cases 48 hours given,\u201d he argues.
 \xa0, Our Correspondent reports: Mr. Singhvi argues citing innumerable occasions when post-poll alliances have been called despite single largest party. \u201cOne of them is when Congress was single largest in Goa,\u201d he says and quotes Chandrakant Kavlekar order of April 2017. He goes on to quote the Bommai and Rameshwar Prasad verdicts. Mr. Singhvi then reads from the Rameshwar Prasad verdict: \u201cDiscretion of Governor in dissolution of existing govt. Same discretion will apply to inviting new Chief Minister.\u201d, PTI quotes Mr. Singhvi telling the Bench: \u201cThe BJP has only 104 MLAs, the Governor invited Mr. Yeddyurappa to form government in an unconstitutional manner". Mr. Kumaraswamy with Congress has 116 MLAs, he adds.
 Singhvi begins: \u201cToday Congress meets...\u201d Justice Bobde reminds: \u201cYesterday, Mr. Singhvi, yesterday. We are in today.\u201d, Additional Solicitor-General Maninder Singh joins hearing.
 Singhvi says, \u201cGovernor sent his letter at 9 p.m. yesterday for Yeddyurappa to swear in today.\u201d, K.K. Venugopal, Attorney-General arrives at the Court.
 Singhvi says, \u201cRule is clear absolute majority,\u201d and delves into Sarkaria Commission's order of preferences on pre-poll alliances, single largest party, post-poll alliance and coalition.
 \xa0, Hearing begins. Mr. Rohatgi has a preliminary objection. No injunction can be issued against Karnataka Governor and Governor cannot be party, he says.\xa0 Mr. Rohatgi says he is representing some of the BJP MLAs and not Mr. Yeddyurappa, reports our correspondent from the court hall.
 Full house at the pre-dawn hearing in Supreme Court\u2019s Court No. 6. Mukul Rohatgi for the BJP and ASG Tushar Mehta for the Centre are present at the Court. Abhishek Manu Singhvi is in the front row. Waiting for the judges A.K. Sikri, S.A. Bobde and Ashok Bhushan, reports our Legal Correspondent Krishnadas Rajagopal.
 \xa0, \xa0, The last time the Supreme Court held a midnight hearing was in 2015, in the Yakub Memon case.
 At 3.17 a.m. on June 30, 2015, the day of his\xa0execution,\xa0Yakub Memon woke up the Supreme Court to hear him for one last time in an unprecedented early morning hearing in the highest court's long history.
 \xa0The lone death row convict in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case told a quickly assembled Bench that he accepts himself as a condemned man, but only wanted to live for another 14 days so that he "could make his peace with God and settle his earthly affairs before leaving this world.", \xa0, The Supreme Court has agreed to hear at 1.45 a.m. the petition filed by the Congress-JD(S) challenging the Karnataka Governor\u2019s decision to invite the BJP to form the government in Karnataka.
 Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra has constituted a Bench comprising Justices A.K. Sikri, S.A. Bobde and Ashok Bhushan to hear the matter in court number six.
 The petition has sought a stay on the oath-taking ceremony, as communicated by the Governor to Mr. Yeddyurappa.
 In a midnight legal push, the Congress had approached the Supreme Court seeking an immediate intervention by the chief justice to stay the move, which it termed as an \u201cencounter of the Constitution\u201c.
 The Congress urged Justice Misra to hold an urgent hearing in the night itself since Mr. Yeddyurappa is slated to take oath as Chief Minister at 9 a.m.
 Mr. Singhvi said the party sought hearing on its petition challenging the Governor\u2019s decision tonight itself.
 The Congress termed the Governor\u2019s decision as \u201cmurder of democracy and trampling of Constitution\u201c.
 And the government is expected to be represented by ASG Tushar Mehta.
 \xa0, \xa0, The Secretary-General of the Supreme Court along with other senior registrars have reached the residence of the Chief Justice apparently to inform him about the Congress- JD(S) petition seeking an urgent hearing on the issue.
 Security has been beefed up tonight and a strong posse of policemen deployed on the way leading to the 5, Krishna Menon Marg residence of CJI Dipak Misra.
 \n\n, As a midnight political drama was played out, traffic was diverted and barricades were placed at various places on the Krishna Menon Marg, even as journalists rushed to the CJI\u2019s residence in anticipation that advocates for the Congress party will mention the petition for urgent hearing in the case tonight itself.
 One of the policemen said they were only informed that some VIP movements are likely to take place and therefore, security arrangements have been made. Security was also stepped up around the Supreme Court premises where the lawyers for the Congress met the registrar.
 Only one gate, i.e. Gate No E, was opened for the lawyers and court staff. The journalists were kept out.
 A large number of policemen and PCR vans were seen stationed there.
 \xa0, Abhishek Manu Singhvi is leading the Congress-JD(S) challenge against the Karnataka Governor\u2019s decision. He tweets: \u201cSince swearing in now announced for 9 am on 17/5/18, in a 9 pm invite by Governor today to (Mr. Yeddyurappa) to form Govt, urgency to seek listing in Supreme Court tonight is self-validating. If Supreme Court registry accepts petitioners\u2019 request on basis of petition settled by me and filed tonight, I will appear and argue tonight.\u201d, \xa0, Mr. Kumaraswamy has slammed the Governor\u2019s decision and accused the Narendra Modi government of misusing Constitutional institutions. \u201cWe will not let it go easily...\u201d, a furious Mr. Kumaraswamy told reporters shortly after the Governor wrote to Mr. Yeddyurappa.\xa0, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the Governor should have given three or four days time for Mr. Yeddyurappa to prove his majority. \u201cHe (Mr. Yeddyurappa) has no majority,\u201d Mr. Kumaraswamy said.
 \u201cIt will be a repeat of 2008...they will loot the State,\u201d he said, referring to the then BJP rule. Asked about the next step, he said, \u201cWait and see.\u201d, Congress approached Supreme Court registrar late on Wednesday evening seeking urgent relief, say sources. Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi will move a petition on Thursday morning.
 Congress has urged Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra to hold an urgent hearing tonight itself.
 Black letter day for the Constitution, says Congress reacting to the development. \u201cBy trashing the Constitution and murdering democracy, tomorrow an illegitimate government will take oath," says partry spokesman Randeep Surjewala.\xa0\xa0, \u201cLetter of Governor clearly shows that even he doesn't believe that BJP has the numbers.\u201d, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Governor had the leeway to exercise his discretion as per the bounds of the Constitution. "Both Sarkaria and M M Punchi commission were clear on the order in which parties were to be invited to form the government", Mr. Prasad said.
 "Number one, the biggest pre-poll alliance, secondly the single largest party staking a claim, thirdly a post poll alliance,\u201d the Law Minister said.
 \u201cCongress is raising a protest because they haven\u2019t been able to digest the loss in Karnataka\u201d, Mr. Prasad said.
 \u201cCongress CM fought from two seats, he lost one seat, barely managed to win the other, and was projected as a dynamic CM who brought in the golden age in Karnataka. Sixteen of his Ministers also lost. What is the signal about the mandate here?, \u201cI ask Rahul and Sonia Gandhi who harp on their legacy, in 1989 the Congress had the largest number of seats but his father Rajiv Gandhi declared that the mandate was against him and was for V.P. Singh and others. Is Rahul Gandhi unaware of the democratic tradition within his own family?\u201d, BJP leader Muralidhar Rao says that the Governor has invited Mr. Yeddyurappa to form the government. He will take oath at 9 a.m. tomorrow. Just now, Governor\u2019s office has given us the letter, inviting Mr. Yeddyurappa to take oath and form the government.\xa0 I welcome the invitation.", Mr. Rao says: \u201cBJP has always followed core democratic principles. There is well laid out procedure... when clear majority is not there... in such a situation, when there is no pre-poll alliance, according to the Constitution and Supreme Court observation in S.R. Bommai case, the single largest party should be called and be given an opportunity to form government.\u201d, \u201cBJP is the single largest party. Of 222 seats, BJP has won 104 seats. The other two parties had fought against each other. They fought bitterly. Criticised each other. Personalised attacks were also other. All are in public domain. The result is complete rejection of Siddaramaiah government,\u201d says Mr. Rao. "We will prove majority on the floor of the house. While giving the invitation, the Governor has said floor test should be held within 15 days.\u201d, \n\n, @BJP4Karnataka the official twitter handle of the Karnataka unit of the BJP has tweeted this: \u201cThe moment that crores of Kannadigas are awaiting is here. Sri BSYBJP will take oath as Chief Minister of Karnataka tomorrow morning at 9.00 AM at Raj Bhavan. The movement to build our Suvarna Karnataka has started.\u201d, \n\n, BJP leader Basavaraj Bommai says the party has received the invitation. Mr. Yeddyurappa will take oath at 9 a.m. Governor has given 15 days to prove majority, he adds.
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will hold a press conference at 9.30 p.m. on Karnataka developments. The Congress has scheduled another press conference at 10 p.m.
 BJP spokesperson and Rajajinagar MLA S. Suresh Kumar has now deleted his tweet announcing the swearing in of Yeddyurappa tomorrow.
 Congress leaders P. Chidamabaram, Kapil Sibal, Vivek Tankha and Randeep Surjewala are giving a press conference on the Karnataka developments.
 \u201cAs we are doing this press conference, we heard the Governor may have invited Yeddyuruppa, but none has been able to confirm it. We are proceeding on the basis that the Governor has not acted,\u201d Mr. Chidambaram says.
 \u201cWhat has stopped the Governor from inviting H.D. Kumaraswamy, leader of the alliance that commands the majority of the Assembly?, \u201cThe only way to uphold the Constitution is to invite the Congress-JD(S) alliance,\u201d he says.
 Mr. Sibal says \u201cMan ki Baat\u201d has now become \u201cDhan Ki baat\u201d.
 Asked about moving court or approaching the President, Mr. Sibal says, \u201cWe have the options open, and will decide which one to take.\u201d, Mr. Chidamabaram says there are many options between now and tomorrow morning but can\u2019t comment on which option to take without confirmation from the Raj Bhavan. \u201cIf the Governor does not invite Kumaraswamy, then he is encouraging horse-trading.\u201d, Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala says Congress and JD(S) are ready to parade all their 117 MLAs.
 Mr. Chidamabaram says, \u201cWe still hope that the Governor will follow the only path available to him, the Constitutional path.\u201d, Mr. Yeddyurappa will be sworn in as Chief Minister at 9.30 a.m. on May 17, BJP spokesperson and Rajajinagar MLA S. Suresh Kumar tweets in Kannada.

 \u201cLet us take part in this momentous ceremony in large numbers,\u201d Mr. Kumar added in the tweet.
 The lone Bahujan Samaj Party MLA N. Mahesh, who has been elected from Kollegal constituency in Chamarajanagar district, has claimed that some BJP office-bearers got in touch with him seeking support to form government. "However, I asked them to get in touch with our national leader Mayawati. I am firmly with JD(S)," he said. The BSP went to polls in alliance with the JD(S). It contested in 20 seats and won in one.
 Members of the Congress and JD(S) met the Governor of Karnataka at around 5 p.m. on Wednesday. KPCC President G. Parameshwara, who met the Governor along with JD(S) chief H. D. Kumaraswamy, said letters with signature of 117 MLAs were submitted to the Governor.
 \n\n, "The Governor has promised that he will get back to us after seeking legal opinion on the matter," he said.
 When asked if all the MLAs are with the parties both Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Parameshwara said, "they were intact.", PTI adds:, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the Governor told the delegation that after consulting legal experts on the Supreme Court judgments, he would \u201ccome to a decision and inform us about it.\u201d Next step has to be decided by the Governor, he added.
 \u201cGovernor said he will decide about considering our claim in accordance with the Constitution. I hope that he will abide by the Constitution and give his direction,\u201d he said.
 Mr. Parameshwara said a copy of the resolution passed at the Congress Legislature Party was submitted to the Governor.
 The Governor said he would act in accordance with the law, based on apex court judgments and as per the constitution while also looking at precedents followed earlier in states like Goa, Mizoram, Nagaland and Manipur, he said.
 Election Commission sources say that the gazette notification on the conclusion of poll process is likely to be submitted to the Governor's office in a couple of hours. The Governor is expected to take a call on inviting which group to form government after receiving the notification.
 \n\n, In a statement, the Left party alleged that the constitutional office of the Governor was being misused in the southern state.
 \u201cThe politburo of the CPI(M) strongly opposes the time given to the BJP to indulge in naked horse-trading and the use of money power to muster a majority in the Karnataka Assembly.
 \xa0, Mr. Siddaramaiah has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of encouraging horse-trading to lure Congress and JD(S) legislators to their party for forming the government.
 \u201cModi and Shah are supporting BJP leaders in horse-trading to poach legislators of our party and the Janata Dal (Secular) to prevent us from forming the next government in the state,\u201d IANS quoted Mr. Siddaramaiah as saying in Bengaluru.
 Asserting that the party would not allow the BJP to form a government in the state at any cost, Mr. Siddaramaiah said none of the Congress legislators were missing or likely to defect to the BJP. \u201cWe have a plan to safeguard our MLAs, who are together and will not join the BJP, which has 8 less seats for the 112-halfway mark and prove majority,\u201d Mr. Siddaramaiah said.
 \u201cWe have extended our support to the JD(S) to form the new government, with its State leader H.D. Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister. As we have the numbers (118), Governor Vajubhai R. Vala should call our alliance first than the BJP, which does not have the required numbers,\u201d Mr. Siddaramaiah pointed out.
 \xa0, The Congress and the JD(S) will parade their MLAs before the Governor at 5 p.m. JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has left the Shangri-La Hotel for the Raj Bhavan. A bus has been kept ready near the KPCC office to take the MLAs to Raj Bhavan.
 JD(S) MLAs have already reached the Raj Bhavan for their \u201cparade\u201d before Governor Vajubhai Vala. The Congress legislators are expected to reach the Raj Bhavan soon.
 Union Mininister Prakash Javadekar dismissed Mr. Kumaraswamy\u2019s charge that BJP was offering \u20b9100 crore to lure its MLAs, calling it \u201cimaginary.\u201d, Meanwhile, outgoing Chief Minister Siddaramaiah accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of encouraging horse-trading. \u201cWe have 117 MLAs. Governor has to give the opportunity to us (JD(S)-Congress combine) to form the government,\u201d he said.
 \n\n, Mr. Kumaraswamy accused the BJP of offering \u20b9100 crore to some of its party members.
 Speaking at the Janata Dal Legislative Party meeting, Mr. Kumaraswamy warned the BJP that if it tried \u2018Operation Lotus\u2019 once more it would backfire.
 \u201cIf the BJP indulges in horse trading I will not sit quiet. I am not a Sanyasi to keep quiet and watch the proceedings,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to tell the Governor that he should not allow horse trading.\u201d, \n, He said the Congress-JD(S) combine had a \u201cclear majority\u201d with the support of 116 MLAs.
 \u201cWithout the numbers, how can they (BJP) form the government?\u201d he asked.
 Mr. Kumaraswamy downplayed the criticism by the Congress in the run-up to the polls. \u201cIt is natural in politics. Wasn\u2019t Yeddyurappa once a bitter critic of the BJP... and now its CM candidate?\u201d, ***, What is Operation Lotus?, This was the BJP\u2019s political manoeuvre in 2008 when, short of majority, it poached at least 6 JD(S) and Congress MLAs by making them resign from the assembly membership and later contest on the BJP ticket.
 \n\n, Mr. Kumaraswamy was elected as the leader of the Legislature Party at a Janata Dal (Secular) party meeting on Wednesday.
 Until Tuesday morning, Mr. Kumaraswamy, State president of the JD(S), was identified as the \u201ckingmaker\u201d, who would ally with either national party in case of an unclear verdict in the elections. By evening, with a fractured mandate, he was transformed to become a \u201cpossible king\u201d in a day of swift developments.

 \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n, BJP has reached out to JD(S) asking for their support, according to sources.
 Union Ministers Prakash Javdekar, J.P. Nadda and Dharmendra Pradhan met H.D. Kumaraswamy at a private hotel in the city and sought JD(S) support to BJP, sources confirmed.
