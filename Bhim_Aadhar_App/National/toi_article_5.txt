Mela with a difference: Be part of Digi Dhan fair to know about digital transactions
BENGALURU: This is a mela with a difference. Pegged to the countryâs demonetisation mood, a Digi Dhan mela has been travelling from city to city to spread awareness about digital transactions. All transactions conducted through RuPay Card, NPCIâs Bhim app, USSD-based *99# service and Aadhaar-Enabled Payment Service (AePS) are eligible for winning prizes. The schemes were launched by the Niti Ayog on December 25 to encourage people to opt for digital cashless transactions. âI congratulate banks for their efforts, but at the same time, I request them to start adopting more gram panchayats; spread more awareness about cashless economy and the digital privileges made available to everyone there,â said Union minister statistics and programme implementation D V Sadananda Gowda during the mela launch on Monday. The mela will travel to Mangaluru, Mysuru and Hubli-Dharwad this week.
