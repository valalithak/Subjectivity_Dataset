Earn Rs 10 for every successful referral for BHIM app
NEW DELHI: Soon after the launch of the BHIM-Aadhar service in Nagpur today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced a reward of Rs 10 for every time a user of the Bhim app successfully refers the app to someone else.  "If you add a person to the BHIM app, after 3 transactions by the person, Rs.10 will be added to your account,..the scheme will continue till October 14," PM Modi said in an address in Nagpur this afternoon.  BHIM-Aadhar, its APP is called Aadhar Pay doesn't require a phone or a bank card, and doesn't need you to be literate. A thumbprint and an Aadhar card are all that are needed for a merchant to receive customer's payment. This is the biometric push toward ensuring a wider digital India.  "There was a time when using your thumbprint was seen as a sign of illiteracy. Today, technology has made the thumbs a source of power. People use their thumbs on phones ... which is great for cashless economy," the PM said today in Nagpur, even as he mimicked millennial users often portrayed with their heads downward flicking their fingers over their smartphones.  Modi said the BHIM app is unstoppable."If the cashless economy is a chariot, the BHIM app is the charioteer. It's unstoppable," the PM said. He said looks forward to the day when people walk around with absolutely no money in their pockets. I see five policemen guarding one ATM and I'm astonished. If we dealt without so much cash, your mobile phone will become your ATM. A day isn't far away when banks have no premises or paper," PM Modi said.
