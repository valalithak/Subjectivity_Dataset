Earn Rs 10 for every successful referral for BHIM app
NEW DELHI: Soon after the launch of the BHIM-Aadhar service in Nagpur today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced a reward of Rs 10 for every time a user of the Bhim app successfully refers the app to someone else.  âIf you add a person to the BHIM app, after 3 transactions by the person, Rs.10 will be added to your account,..the scheme will continue till October 14,â PM Modi said in an address in Nagpur this afternoon.  BHIM-Aadhar â its APP is called Aadhar Pay â doesnât require a phone or a bank card, and doesnât need you to be literate. A thumbprint and an Aadhar card are all that are needed for a merchant to receive customerâs payment. This is the biometric push toward ensuring a wider digital India.  âThere was a time when using your thumbprint was seen as a sign of illiteracy. Today, technology has made the thumbs a source of power. People use their thumbs on phones ... which is great for cashless economy,â the PM said today in Nagpur, even as he mimicked millennial users often portrayed with their heads downward flicking their fingers over their smartphones.  Modi said the BHIM app is âunstoppable.â  âIf the cashless economy is a chariot, the BHIM app is the charioteer. Itâs unstoppable,â the PM said. He said looks forward to the day when people walk around with absolutely no money in their pockets.  âI see five policemen guarding one ATM and Iâm astonished. If we dealt without so much cash, your mobile phone will become your ATM. A day isnât far away when banks have no premises or paper,â PM Modi said.
