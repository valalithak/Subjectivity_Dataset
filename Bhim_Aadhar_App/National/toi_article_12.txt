PM Narendra Modi to launch Aadhaar Pay platform on Ambedkar's birth anniversary
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will next week launch the government's new digital payments initiative that aims to make banking accessible to people who could not read or write.
 
 The initiative, christened Aadhaar Pay, is a biometric-based payment system that will allow an Aadhaar-linked account holder carry out all his banking transactions just by the use of his thumb impression. Modi will launch the scheme on April 14 to mark the birth anniversary of Dalit icon Bhim Rao Ambedkar.

 "This is in line with the government's initiative to popularise digital payments," a senior government official said. The official said the finance ministry has already asked all public sector banks to board the Aadhaar Pay platform by April 14. Earlier this month, private sector IDFC Bank became the first lender to launch Aadhaar Pay through its network.

 The ministry has also asked state-run banks to encourage merchants to board the Aadhaar Pay platform. "In the next two weeks, we expect 5 lakh merchants on board," said the official quoted above. Last year, while launching the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app, Modi had said that there was a time when unlettered people were lampooned and referred as 'angootha chaap'.

 "But now, the thumb impression would make way for a person's bank, identity and even business," he had said.

 The government has advised state-run banks to ensure that rental payments are structured in such a manner that small merchants do not have to pay rental of more than Rs 100 per month on installation of PoS terminals.

 As per the latest government data, 98 per cent of adults or more than 108 crore people in India had been issued Aadhaar cards until February.
