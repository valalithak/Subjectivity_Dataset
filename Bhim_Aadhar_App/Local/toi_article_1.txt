Tepid response to BHIM app: Blame it on ignorance
HYDERABAD: Even months after the launch of Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) application by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the application remains largely unused in the city with people not aware about it. Soon after demonetisation, several vendors adopted the payment gateways like Paytm, for their daily transactions. However, they failed to switch to Bhim application as many are unaware of it. "I am unaware of this application, recently another friend of mine told me about it. The app does not charge anything for transaction as the amount directly gets credited to the account. However, no customers seem to be aware of this application, so it has become useless for us," said Jagan Raju, who runs a kirana shop in Ameerpet. The vendors have said that due to lack of awareness among the people, the application is underutilised. "The customers are comfortable with Paytm. Though they have to pay transaction charges, people are comfortable with Paytm, as they have used it and everyone have it installed. Though Bhim, which is an Unified Payment Interface (UPI) app, uses directly bank account of the user for transactions, it is easy for customers and traders to use Paytm," said Dinesh Singh, a shopkeeper from Begumpet. Dinesh said because of lack of promotion of the app in the city, people are still using alternatives even after extra transaction charges. The National Payments Corporation of India has claimed that till June 30, 2017 there were over 16 million BHIM app downloads and the Unified Payments Interface is currently enabled with 52 banks. "It is getting some response, however, it is hard to tell exactly how many are using. It has the potential to compete with other payment gateways and soon people will start using it in regular basis," said an official from National Payments Corporation of India.
