PUNE: The government may have to postpone its decision to go cashless in the next three months. The state wanted to follow in the Centre's footsteps by making its transactions cashless with the use of Bhim-Aadhaar Pay App, a biometric-based payment system. In a bid to promote a cashless economy, the state government had been planning to shift entirely to a cashless transaction system wherein the government would stop accepting cash for all kinds of fees, taxes and fines from citizens. The transactions that were to go digital include property tax payment, stamp duty, fees for land transfer, licence fees, fines and electricity bills."In rural areas, it plans to start with BHIM-Aadhaar Pay app and in cities, the existing credit card and other modes of cashless system will be continued," stated the IT official.  He added that there will be some hiccups but it will be rolled out. Unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May this year, the BHIM-Aadhaar Pay app provides a tool that can be a one-stop solution for all digital payments. VK Gautam, principal secretary, information technology department, said the BHIM-Aadhaar Pay app links citizens' Aadhaar number and fingerprints to complete a transaction in a safe and secure manner. To enable transactions through the app, the government only needs a thumb impression, for which 1.40 lakh biometric machines have been procured. These will be installed in all gram panchayats, tehsildars and collectorates to ensure cashless transactions. To complete the transaction, the person concerned will have to submit his Aadhaar details and the amount he or she wants to pay through the BHIM-Aadhaar Pay app and give his thumb impression to authenticate his biometric details. The amount will be deducted from his account. "We will stop taking cash for all kinds of payments, fees, fines and taxes imposed by the state government once machines are installed at government offices across the state," Gautam said.
