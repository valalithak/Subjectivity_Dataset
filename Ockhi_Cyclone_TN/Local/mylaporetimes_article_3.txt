Dead fish on shores of coastal colonies; happens on Tuesday too
 For the second day, that is on Tuesday dead fish washed up on the shores of Srinivasapuram, the colony at the far end of Foreshore Estate.  Hundreds had floated to the shore side since Monday afternoon.
And as some fisher folks had said, it was confirmed on Tuesday that the fish have been dying around the sea where the Adyar river flows out because of severe depletion of oxygen in the water.
Experts say the depletion could be due to steady and heavy flow of waste/sewage into the river, cause perhaps due to the monsoon rain flow.
The washing up of dead fish has also been reported from fisher folks on the south side of the river – Besant Nagar’s colonies.
The worrying factor here is of dead fish being carted by some folk to local markets to be sold.
