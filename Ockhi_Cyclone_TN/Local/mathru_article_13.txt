Thiruvananthapuram: The centre has cut Rs 143.54 cr from the relief fund that was announced for Kerala. The Centre took this measure as the amount given to State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) was not spent.
The meeting which was held on December 6 under union minister Rajnath Singh had sanctioned Rs 3048 cr for Kerala. The order by home department assistant director dated December 10 had asked the financial ministry to give Rs 2304.85 cr. The financial ministry circle told Mathrubhumi that Rs 600 cr that was sanctioned earlier and 143.54 cr remaining in Ochki has been deducted from the fund.
Additional chief secretary PH Kurian, who is in charge of SDRF, has also confirmed that the fund reducing this amount was received. He said that this fund can be used by SDRF next year and he had predicted this. But, he didn’t respond to the question whether the deducted amount will be given later.
The finance ministry circles said that the centre usually sanctions fund by deducting the amount that was not spent. They clarified that this amount will not be given later.
The amount was handed over to the state treasury on December 13 when LDF-UDF dharna was held on the parliament premises seeking more help for rebuilding. MP Veerendra Kumar MP had asked for special financial help in the Rajya Sabha the previous day. The union minister of home Kiran Rijiju said there wasn’t any provision for this.
The studies conducted by World Bank and UN concluded that Kerala has faced a loss of Rs 31000 cr. Kerala sought Rs 5616 cr from the centre. The state had requested for a special package of Rs 5000 cr. The overall loss cannot be solved even if the complete amount is received. The deduction of amount was done amidst these circumstances.


Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has stated recently that the state is supposed to pay the price of rice and kerosene given at the time of floods. If that is the condition, the state will have to return Rs 265.74 cr.
