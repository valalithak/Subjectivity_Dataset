The rain is back
 The rain is back. The post-noon dark skies had prepared people for the downpour this Wednesday evening. The rain, light at first and then  strong in parts continued as peak-hour traffic on Mylapore’s main roads began to crawl.
Rasikas who got in early at the Bhavan’s auditorium for the music festival concerts sat through them, some keeping a ear open for updates on the weather. The critical among the rasikas do not like the way in which many others walk in ands walk out of concerts, which are free to all.
Motorists who were driving through Mandaveli towards the Adyar side had to be patient as traffic slowed down at the Jesus Calls headquarters junction.
