Forget Tesla, this Indian battery can change the fate of e-cars
India could be playing a very important role in the hunt for clean fuel. On Tuesday, it took a step close to this by becoming the world's first country to have a thermal battery plant. Set up by Bharat Energy Storage Technology (BEST), the plant in Andhra Pradesh will produce first-of-its-kind thermal cells, aimed at boosting renewable sources of energy production, while maintaining a low carbon footprint. 

Commercial production of these batteries will start by May next year. The Thermal battery technology was patented in India by Dr Patrick Glynn in 2016. The high energy density storage thermal batteries are quite impressive as it lasts longer than current lithium ion batteries and can be used to power electric vehicles and telecom towers. Thermal batteries have little carbon footprints and use of no hard metal or inflammable substances.

A single charge for use in electric buses could deliver an 800-kilometre range. 


How thermal batteries work:Thermal batteries use energy produced by difference of temperature at both ends of the battery. The two sides of the batteries contain hot substance on the one side and cold on the other. The energy transfer from hot to cold side and vice versa helps store heat when heat travels from one part of the battery to the other. 

When the energy flows from hot to cold and cold to hot side, the battery stores energy through this transition process. Depending on the nature of the battery, the system can draw heat from any source, which makes a thermal battery very versatile.
