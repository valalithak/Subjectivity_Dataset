Siliguri, Nov. 23: The unrest in the Darjeeling hills has made tour operators apprehensive of the possibility of long-term damage to the region’s tourism industry. 
“Following the recent four-day strike call, about 35-40 tourists who had booked tours to Darjeeling through our company had to cancel their trips,” said a tour operator who did not want to be named.
“When the strike was called off yesterday, we took some tourists to Darjeeling. Now, violence has broken out there and the army has been called in. On top of that, an indefinite strike has been called today. We are at a loss about what do for the tourists, who are scared and are looking for the first opportunity to get out,” he added.
Some of the tour operators are also seeing the spectre of the Gorkhaland agitation. 
“During the Gorkhaland agitation, tourism was badly hit and all segments — including hotels and transport — had reached an all-time low,” said Raj Basu, the working president of the Eastern Himalayan Travel and Tour Operators’ Association. “Over the last decade, the situation was improving and even major international tour companies had begun to promote this region. But Darjeeling is in turmoil again and it will be very difficult for us to get these tourists back.”
