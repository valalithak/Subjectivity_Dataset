Bodo groups for Gorkhaland
 The Bodo groups in Assam have extended support to the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha's (GJM) agitation for "Gorkhaland" in West Bengal and sought the Centre's intervention to control the situation in Darjeeling.
Bongaigaon, June 17: The Bodo groups in Assam have extended support to the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha's (GJM) agitation for "Gorkhaland" in West Bengal and sought the Centre's intervention to control the situation in Darjeeling.
The All Bodo Students' Union, People's Joint Committee for Bodoland Movement and the NDFB (P) jointly issued a statement saying that movements demanding creation of separate states gained momentum in the country after the UPA government created Telangana state in 2009.
The release says the demands for Bodoland and Gorkhaland are "historically and constitutionally legitimate" but the Centre is apathetic towards these demands.
It says the "outburst of tension in Darjeeling is nothing but an unwarranted outcome of the autocratic rule of the West Bengal government" and the Centre's "negligence" towards the problem.
"We condemn the unprovoked atrocious act by West Bengal police and their torture of unarmed civilians on the streets of Darjeeling," the note, signed by Absu president Pramod Boro and NDFB (P) chairman B. Sungthagra, among others, says.
In Calcutta, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the GJM has connections with insurgent groups in the Northeast, reports PTI.
