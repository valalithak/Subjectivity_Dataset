Darjeeling violence: A political opportunity in the making for the BJP?
The Darjeeling hills in West Bengal are on fire with the Gorkhaland agitation getting shriller. This is not the first time there is an agitation to demand a separate Gorkha state.

 But what is unique about the current agitation is its wider political context of the open tussle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC). The BJP is being seen as the party that might end up getting political benefit out of the agitation.

 The BJP sees West Bengal as the last frontier in eastern India. After tasting electoral success in Assam, it is confident that it can make further inroads in the other states of the region.

 But given Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's stronghold on grassroots politics and a weak opposition, the BJP is trying to find a toehold. There are slim chance of West Bengal being swept in a saffron wave anytime soon.

The BJP has backed the demand for a separate Gorkha state for long. In 2015, Darjeeling 
MP SS Ahulwalia had said: "The Biharis say they are from Bihar, the Punjabis say they belong to Punjab. When will the Gorkhas say that they belong to Gorkhaland? Their dreams should also come true."

 The BJP seems to be counting heavily on the Gorkha support during the next general elections.


Many think the BJP's support to the Gorkha movement might polarise the state and keep the mainstream Bengali voter away from the BJP.

 But the BJP seems to have the two-pronged strategy of appeasing the Gorkhas by backing their demands while tapping in to the general discontent with the Mamata government among the mainland Bengalis.
