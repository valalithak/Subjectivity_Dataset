 The weather system that was first noticed nearly five days ago, grew into a \u2018very severe cyclonic storm\u2019 and by the time it crossed the city near the Chennai Port, it had weakened into a \u2018severe cyclonic storm\u2019 with maximum wind speeds touching 110 kmph-120 kmph.
 This was a large weather system, measuring nearly 40 km in diameter, which explains the time taken for the system to cross.
 There was a lull between 2-30 p.m. and 5 p.m. as the eyewall of the cyclone was in transit and it normally is empty, bringing very little, or no rainfall.
 \n, The total rainfall received from early Monday up to 6 p.m. was 16 cm in the Chennai region alone, according to the Meteorological department.
 By 8 p.m. the windspeeds decreased to 60-70 kmph, and the system now a \u2018cyclonic storm\u2019 moved westwards, bringing moderate to heavy rainfall to the interior areas as well. Rainfall over the northern coastal districts is expected to continue till Tuesday noon. Vardah, an Urdu word meaning red rose, contributed by Pakistan, will turn into a deep depression early on Tuesday, sources said.
