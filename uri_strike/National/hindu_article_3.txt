 Mr. Singh said there were definite and credible indications that the attackers were \u201chighly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped.\u201d, \u201cI am deeply disappointed with Pakistan\u2019s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,\u201d Mr. Singh said in a message posted on Twitter.
 A senior Home Ministry official said till afternoon, the security agencies were not sure whether Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) or Jaish-e-Mohammad, both Pakistan-based, were behind the attack. It was only by evening that it became clear that the JeM was behind the attack. The January 2 attack at the Pathankot airbase was also carried out by the JeM.
 \u201cThere was an uncertainty on the terrorist group involved in the attack in the morning but one thing was sure that the attack had been meticulously planned by Pakistan\u2019s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). The terrorists knew the precise location to be targeted and were well-trained,\u201d said the official privy to the meeting chaired by the Home Minister.
 Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) chief Rajinder Khanna, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi were also present in the meeting.
 More terror attacks are expected in the coming days due to the continuing unrest in Kashmir and the Army being redeployed to the hinterland in South Kashmir from the forward areas, said another official.
  \u201cUri attack, this is my old HQ. Warned the Cdr specifically on September 8. Happened in 10 days. Done to remove pressure from hinterland army move,\u201d Lt Gen Ata Hasnain, former General Officer Commanding (GOC) 15 and 21 Corps tweeted.
  South Kashmir has been simmering with protests since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen\u2019s commander Burhan Wani in an encounter in July 8. With violence going unabated, the Army was asked to send in additional forces to the trouble spots in the South.
 Mr. Singh was to leave for Russia on Sunday for a four-day visit. Post-return from Russia, he was to again leave on a week-long visit to the U.S. on September 27 to attend the Homeland Security dialogue.
 A message posted by the Home Minister's Twitter handle said, \u201cKeeping the situation of Jammu and Kashmir in mind and in the wake of the terror attack in Uri, I have postponed my visits to Russia and the USA.\u201d, Earlier, Mr. Singh had to visit the U.S. in July but the unrest in the Valley had led him to postpone the meeting.
 \u201cI have given instructions to the Home Secretary and other senior officers in MHA to closely monitor the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d another tweet by Mr. Singh said.
