 South Kashmir has been simmering with protests since the killing of Burhan Wani,, Hizbul Mujahideen\u2019s commander, in an encounter in July. With violence going unabated, the Army was asked to send in additional forces to the trouble spots in the South.
 More attacks are feared because the number of successful cross-border infiltrations have gone up drastically in recent months and so has the number of terrorists killed in such attempts.
 According to official figures as on July 31, there were 72 successful infiltrations across the Line of Control compared to 30\u2019s for the whole of last year.][]
