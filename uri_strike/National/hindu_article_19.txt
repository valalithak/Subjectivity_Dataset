 [][][\nSoldiers guard the army base which was attacked by militants in Uri, west of Srinagar, on Sunday.\n\xa0 ][Initial reports indicate that the four slain terrorists who carried out the largest attacks on the Army in Kashmir \u201cbelong to Jaish-e-Mohammad tanzeem,\u201d the Army announced. The Army has lost 17 soldiers in the attack and over 30 have been injured.
 \u201cSome the terrorists had some items with Pakistani markings, I have spoken spoke to Pakistan DGMO and conveyed our serious concerns on the same,\u201d Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Ranbir Singh said in a statement to the media on Sunday.
 Recounting the sequence of events, Lt Gen Singh said that four heavily armed terrorists had opened fire on an administrative base of the Army at Uri in Kashmir at approximately 05:30 hrs in the morning and the operation continued till around 08:30.
 He observed that four Ak-47 rifles and four under barrel grenade launchers along with a large number of war like stored were recovered from them. \u201cThe terrorists fired incendiary ammunition along with automatic fire of small arms that led to Army tents/ temporary shelters catching fire, Lt Gen Singh said which explains the high casualties.
 The additional tents located in the complex were to house additional troops inducted due to routine turnover of troops. A transition of Army units was underway and 10 Dogra was being replaced by 6 Bihar regiment. In the past too attacks had taken place during such troops shifts which are generally kept under wraps.
 Officials said that the transition time is seen as a relatively easier time to target as new troops are taking positions and the guard tends to be lowered.
 \u201cTroops of 6 Bihar were accommodated in tents. Terrorists put tents on fire and then shot the troops when they were rushing out,\u201d sources said. Due to this officials said the casualty rate was very high and most of the soldiers killed belonged to 6 Bihar regiment.
 \u201cOf the 17 casualties, 13-14 have been due to the tents/shelters having caught fire,\u201d Lt Gen Singh stated. As of evening the operation for clearance of the area was still on and a deliberate search of the area was being carried out around the military complex in Uri.
 \u201cI would like to assure you that the Army remains prepared to thwart any nefarious designs and any evil designs of the adversary shall be given a befitting reply,\u201d Lt Gen Singh added echoing the tough statement made earlier by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
