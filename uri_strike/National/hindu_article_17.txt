 \nSitharaman condemns Uri attack\n, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman condemned the terrorist attack on an Army battalion headquarters in Uri town and said no such threat is going to deter the country from restoring peace and normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir.
 \u201cIt is absolutely condemnable...They can continuously keep threatening us with these activities, but India is strong enough to take care of its internal security and no such threat is going to deter us from restoring peace and normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d she told reporters at the BJP\u2019s State Women\u2019s Executive Meeting here.
 In one of the deadliest attacks on the Army in recent years, 17 jawans were killed and 19 others injured as heavily armed militants stormed a battalion headquarters of the force in North Kashmir\u2019s Uri town in the wee hours today.
 Four militants involved in the terror strike were killed by the Army.
 Asked about the recent demand of J&amp;K BJP MLAs for \u201cbombing\u201d and destroying terror camps in Pakistan after an attack on a CRPF convoy in the valley that left eight personnel dead in June, Sitharaman said, \u201cBoth the Centre and the state government would work towards bringing normalcy and peace in the state.\u201d, \u201cAs regards the way in which (it) is going to be done, the central and state governments will strategise to work towards it,\u201d she said.
 On the Cauvery water-sharing issue, Ms. Sitharaman said it would not be proper to seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s intervention as the matter is under adjudication.
 \u201cI think our position was made very clear by our Karnataka BJP President B S Yedyurappaji that the matter is in the court and it is under adjudication. So, it may not be proper to ask the Prime Minister to intervene,\u201d she said.][]
