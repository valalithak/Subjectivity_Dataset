NEW DELHI — A Kashmiri human rights activist was taken into police custody early Friday shortly after he was prevented from boarding a plane to Geneva to address a session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The activist, Khurram Parvez, is “under preventive custody on orders from a magistrate who is interrogating him,” said Sheikh Faisal, the superintendent of police in East Srinagar. Mr. Parvez, who leads the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, planned to submit a “civil society stakeholder’s report” to the rights council on the situation in Kashmir. The death of a separatist group commander in July has ignited some of the most serious instability in the contested area in years, with a series of clashes between stone-throwing protesters and Indian security forces. More than 70 people, most of them civilians, have been killed since unrest broke out on July 9, and thousands of civilians and security forces have been wounded. Hundreds of protesters have been treated for “dead eyes,” the result of the security forces firing birdshot into crowds to maintain order. Mr. Parvez’s report, which was submitted to the council on Wednesday, cataloged human rights violations by the Indian security forces during the protests. Mr. Parvez was visiting relatives Thursday evening when he was asked to report to a police station to speak to the police superintendent, said his wife, Sameena Mir. He agreed to go on Friday morning, but police officers arrived at his home after midnight, urging a meeting with the superintendent, she said. When he arrived at the station, he was told he was being detained. She said that, so far, the authorities have not given any reason for the detention. “These kind of things are common here, and although I am worried, I am also at peace,” she said. “I know my husband will be fine.”
