Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said the Uri terror attack could a “reaction” to the situation in Kashmir and criticised India for blaming Pakistan “without any evidence.”
“The Uri attack can be the reaction of the atrocities in Kashmir, as the close relatives and near and dear ones of those killed and blinded over the last two months were hurt and outraged,” Mr. Sharif told reporters in London.
The Prime Minister said India had hastily blamed Pakistan without any investigation. “How could India accuse Pakistan only hours after the Uri incident without holding any inquiry or investigation,” Mr. Sharif was quoted as saying by Pakistani media reports.
“The whole world knows about the Indian atrocities in Kashmir where around 108 people have so far been killed, over 150 blinded and thousands injured,” he said.
India should have a look at its “role” in Kashmir, he said.
He called for a probe into the “killings” of Kashmiris.
Eighteen Indian soldiers were killed in an attack on a highly-guarded Army camp in Uri in Kashmir on Sunday morning.
