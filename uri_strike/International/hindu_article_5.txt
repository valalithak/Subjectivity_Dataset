 [][][][Skirting direct reference to Pakistan and JeM, China on Monday voiced concern over \u201cescalation\u201d of tensions and \u201crising temperatures\u201d in Kashmir after the Uri terror attack and called on India and Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue.
 \u201cWe have noted relevant reports. We are shocked by this attack,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang told media briefing here when asked about Beijing\u2019s reaction to Sunday\u2019s Uri attack and India\u2019s charge that Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) is behind it.
 JeM has special significance as Beijing has put a technical hold over India\u2019s efforts to bring about a UN ban on the outfit\u2019s leader Masood Azhar for his involvement in Pathankot attack.
 Referring to the Uri attack in which 18 soldiers were killed and several injured, Mr. Lu said \u201cwe want to express our deep sympathies and condolences to the affected families and the injured\u201d.
 \u201cChina opposes and strongly condemns all forms of terrorism. We are concerned about this escalation and rising temperatures surrounding Kashmir situation,\u201d he said.
 \u201cWe hope relevant parties will have dialogue and consultation to resolve their differences and enhance counter terrorism cooperation,\u201d Mr. Lu said, without directly referring to India and Pakistan.
 \u201cOnly this way can they safeguard peace and security in their region,\u201d he said.
 Mr. Lu also voiced concern over the fallout of the Uri attack on the $46 billion China\u2014Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) being laid through the PoK and said the project, in which China is investing considerable amount of resources, needs concerted efforts from all countries for its success.
 Asked how China sees the impact of the escalation of violence on the CPEC, Mr. Lu said: \u201cThe building of the corridor is to drive the development of the regional countries. It needs the concerted efforts of all countries concerned to ensure the smooth running of this corridor.\u201d, \u201cAt the same time I need to stress that recently in this region, especially in Kashmir region, there has been some escalation of tensions,\u201d he said.
 \u201cOur position is that we hope all relevant parties can work together and remain committed to resolving these disputes through peaceful consultations and jointly maintain the peace and stability of the region.
 \u201cThis in final analysis is conducive and will bring benefits to China, India, Pakistan and all the regional countries,\u201d he said.][]
