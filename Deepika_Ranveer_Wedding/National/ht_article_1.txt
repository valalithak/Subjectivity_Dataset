He writes, “In her dealings, she is straight-shooting, sharp and fair – an absolute and thorough professional. She’s got inner strength, resilience, grit and an iron will. Her discipline and commitment is unparalleled. Her path breaking achievements have changed the game time and again. A woman so righteous and full of virtue, that she commands respect.”
Calling it inexplicably gratifying, he goes on to add how she preserves a vulnerable and innocent, childlike side of herself exclusively for him. He ends the note saying, “I am the proudest husband in the world. She inspires me to be the best man I can possibly be. She makes my life worth living. She is truly…the light of my life.”
