 \u201cWe are currently running 400 services everyday with 18 trains and by April first week, we are going to increase the number to 22 three-coach trains. Gradually, we will also reduce the time taken for doors to close to 10 seconds from 20 to 45 seconds once we ensure passengers get used to the system,\u201d said Anil Kumar Saini, Chief Operating Officer, L&amp;T Metro Rail Hyderabad on Wednesday.
 Chipped in HMR MD N.V.S. Reddy: \u201cWith Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) to be fully functional between Mettuguda and Begumpet along with the rest of the stretches between Nagole to Mettuguda (8 km) and Miyapur to S.R.Nagar (12 km), the speeds will only improve and increase frequency.\u201d Street-level works too are likely to be completed by then.
 With CBTC not fully functional, frequency of trains between Ameerpet and Miyapur has been one every eight minutes whereas for trains between Ameerpet and Nagole it has been one for every 15 minutes. , The duo was interacting with media persons during the metro ride to Miyapur where the first private two-wheeler bike taxi was inaugurated. \u201cDaily ridership has stabilised at about 70,000 passengers which goes up to 80,000 passengers on the weekend. L&amp;TMRH are happy with the patronage,\u201d said Mr. Reddy.
