 As expected, social media was flooded with free gyan, bouquets and brickbats on Wednesday as citizens of Hyderabad rode the Metro Rail on the first day of its commercial operations. While sharing of selfies with the Metro Rail in the backdrop was the order of the day for commuters, others tried to showcase their photography and videography skills. “Now we are talking about the most famous public transport of Hyderabad...Hyd Metro is one of the best, largest and safe way to travel. I am impressed by Hyd Metro’s efficiency, safety and cleanliness,” wrote Mayur Dasari, embellishing his post with a number of selfies and a video. “Smooth experience so far. Stations/trains could do with better signages to manage flow of people. An accurate ETA of the next train would also be helpful. Lots of ‘May I help’ staff around for now to ease the flow. Surprisingly busy for day 1. Will probably be pretty packed in a month,” wrote Kishor Krishnamoorthi. “Mana City, Mana Metro,” was the coinage of Jagan Mohan, who wrote: “Every Hyderabadi dream of fast, safe and smooth travel. Hyderabad Metro is now synonymous with smooth journey. Come and experience excellent modern and hi-tech travel. Kudos to L&T and Telangana Government.”No aspect of Metro was left untouched by netizens as they debated about the number of toilets, or announcements being inaudible to the constant gripe about the cost of the ticket.Some could not contain their excitement. “@telangana_cmo @KTRTRS Sir - Just Wow!
