Thiruvananthapuram: The state government is not against filing a review petition in the Supreme Court verdict allowing the entry of women in the Sabarimala temple, said Kadakampally Surendran, minister for Devaswom on Sunday. ‘Devaswom board can take decision independently. The government won’t insist its policy over Devaswom board,’ stated the minister.
‘The government has no change in its stance. Devaswom board or individuals have the right to file review petition. The government won’t be a hindrance for that,’ stated the Surendran.
The opposition leader had earlier said that the Devaswom Board has to file a review petition in connection with the SC verdict on Sabarimala. Later, A Padmakumar, the Devaswom Board president said the board will decide to give review petition after discussing it in a board meeting.


Minister Kadakampally made his comments after that.
