Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that they will implement the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala women entry and that there are no plans for a legislation.
The government’s policy is to implement the Supreme Court verdict. Nobody will be allowed to take law into their hands and strict action will be taken against them, the CM clarified in the press conference.
It has been noted that women were blocked on their way to Sabarimala. Not everyone has the authority to check vehicles. All necessary facilities will be arranged for the devotees. Those who oppose them will be discouraged. It is the Devaswom Board that decides its affairs.


The government has no plans to file a review petition. The government has clarified its stand in the court. The stand is that both men and women are equal. Pinarayi Vijayan also made it clear that the government’s duty is to follow the court’s order.
