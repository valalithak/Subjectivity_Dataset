Alappuzha: The Kerala government was not in a rush to implement the supreme court verdict allowing entry of women in Sabarimala, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Sunday.
“If the government wishes, women can be allowed to enter in Sabarimala. However, decision would be taken after discussions regarding customs and traditions,” he said while addressing the audience at a mega gathering organised by LDF here.
The government is responsible for implementing the SC verdict. Some people say that the government was showing a keen interest to implement the same. Minimal interest from LDF can allow entry of women in Sabarimala. But the government is in no rush.
Some people are trying to push Kerala back into the dark days. The women wall demonstration from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram is to safeguard renaissance values against such forces. We will not allow them to turn Kerala into a lunatic asylum. Women and men are equal. Women wall is not a protest against any community but against those who consider women as slaves, he said.
Protests against existing customs have always faced strong opposition. However, those protests did not crumble but became part of history and the state moved forward, he said.
