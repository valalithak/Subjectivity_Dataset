Thiruvananthapuram: The CPI state council slammed chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the Sabarimala women entry issue. It said that CM showed unwanted hurry in implementing the supreme court verdict that allowed women of all age groups to enter Sabarimala temple.
The council further stated that the DGP’s statement on sending young women police officers to Sannidhanam created commotion.
“CM showed unwanted haste to implement the SC verdict on Sabarimala. This led to scepticism among public. More cautious steps including discussions with concerned persons, should have been conducted so as to make the public aware of the need to implement the verdict,” the state council said.
It also criticised that the contradictory stances stated by CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran over the entry of activists to Sabarimala temple and said that it led to confusion among people.


However, CPI is in full support of the CPM-led state government in implementing the SC verdict. The report submitted by CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran at the state council extended full support to the government over the issue.
