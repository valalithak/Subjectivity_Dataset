Palakkad: Hindu Aikya Vedi state president KP Sasikala said that though she respects the supreme court’s verdict on women entry to Sabarimala temple, it was saddening. It is our duty to respect any order made by SC but it shouldn’t have been like this, she said.
The supreme court verdict manages to bring out a stance that the society has no ability to even decide a ritual on its own. She added that the Hindu organizations and devotee organizations should have been taken into confidence and efforts should have been made to move forward on middle grounds.
Women of any age group can enter Sabarimala temple. But shouldn't the devotees decide whether they want to enter the temple or not? All the 'rights' under law won’t go well when connected with life, Sasikala added.
