Kochi: BJP state president PS Sreedharan Pillai stated that the central government cannot pass an ordinance over the Sabarimala issue. The Supreme court has struck down Rule 3 (B) of Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship Act by allowing women of all age groups to Sabarimala temple. It comes under state list of legislative section. So centre cannot make ordinance on it, said the BJP leader.
At the same time, he alleged that politicians like Ramesh Chennithala is misleading the public by demanding the centre to issue an ordinance over the issue.
“The Centre has brought an ordinance on Jallikettu with the centre’s concurrence as the subject is listed in concurrent list of the constitution,” he noted.
He pointed out that he discussed Sabarimala row with many believers and community leaders. 
“Belief is a fundamental right. BJP is striving to protect it. Temple Protection committee and Ayappa seva samajam under Sangh Parivar have completed all formalities to file review petition against the Supreme Court verdict,” said Sreedharan Pillai.
He alleged that the Congress has taken a double standard approach on the issue.
He also observed that it is the responsibility of BJP to counter the verdict.  BJP is planning to strengthen the protest against it and the matter will be discussed in the core committee too.


Meanwhile, he dismissed allegations against the party over the delay to respond on the controversial verdict.
