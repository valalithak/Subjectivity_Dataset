Thiruvananthapuram: BJP state president PS Sreedharan Pillai criticised Supreme Court verdict on entry of women in Sabarimala. He noted that nobody can change the temple customs.
“Every temple has its own unique customs. Nobody can change it. Justice Indu Malhotra, one of the judge in the constitutional bench also noted that notions of rationality cannot be brought into matters of religion. The feelings of the believers should be respected,” stated Sreedharan Pillai.
He declared that BJP’s official stand on the matter will be informed after receiving the copy of the verdict.
“A final decision on allowing women of all age groups in Sabarimala should be taken after consulting with Pandalam royal family and priests,” he added.
The BJP president pointed out that he could not accept the verdict which is taken by an authority who do not believe in God.
He also criticised TDB president’s statement declaring protection to women in the temple.
“CPM’s attempts to convert Sabarimala as a centre for conflict would not be allowed,” he stated.


Meanwhile, former TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan expressed grief over the verdict. He stated that he will move legally against the verdict after studying it.
