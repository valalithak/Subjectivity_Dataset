New Delhi: NSS filed a review petition in the Supreme Court against the verdict which allowed unrestricted entry of women to Sabarimala. The petition pointed out that there were serious flaws in the verdict and there are historical evidences that prove the celibacy of Lord Ayyappa.
The petition stated that the verdict violated the constitutional right for customs and traditions. The religions will not exist if the customs are evaluated on the basis of Section 14, which mustn’t be allowed, it further said.
Evidences of Ayyappa’s celibacy are produced with the petition. The person who had filed the petition to allow entry of all women isn’t related to the case in any way. So the case isn’t technically valid.
NSS also demanded that the review petition must be considered and the hearing should be held in an open court.
People for Dharma, Sabarimala Achara Samrakshana Forum and Panthalam royal family might soon file  review petitions.


There might be a delay in considering the review petitions as the court will be closed for the Pooja holidays from October 12. Then it will reopen on October 22. It is learnt that the judges who had considered the case will not be in Delhi for this period. If the petitioners fail to convince the court about the urgency of the issue, the court might not consider the review petition before the Pooja holidays.
