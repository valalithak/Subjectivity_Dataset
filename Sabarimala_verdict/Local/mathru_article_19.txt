New Delhi: Attorney General KK Venugopal said that the SC verdict allowing unrestricted entry for women to Sabarimala was wrong. He stated that the stance taken by Indu Malhotra was right. Venugopal made these remarks during a private television programme.
The SC verdict hasn’t considered the public sentiments. Even the court wouldn’t have thought that the women will start protests. Devotees are thinking that women's entry might invite the wrath of the god. Attorney general said that there are people who think that the flood havoc was caused incurring the wrath of the Lord.
‘The public sentiments must be taken into consideration. I welcome the verdict of Indu Malhotra,’ he added.
KK Venugopal appeared in the Supreme Court for TDB before becoming attorney general.
