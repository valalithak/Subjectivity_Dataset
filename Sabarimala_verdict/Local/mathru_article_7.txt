Thiruvananthapuram: Travancore Devaswom Board did a volte-face by declaring that no special arrangements will be made for women in Sabarimala.
“Earlier also women visited Sabrimala with the present amenities. Further action on the subject will be taken as per the direction of the High Court," said TDB President A Padmakumar. TDB has not taken a decision to deploy women police in ‘Padinettam Padi’ (18 holy steps) in Sabarimala.
“Arrangements made by former president Prayar Gopalakrishnan will continue this year also. TDB is not adamant that women of all ages should enter Sabarimala,” he added.
However, TDB has not carried out any discussion on deploying women police in Sabarimala. TDB will intimate the court about the present conditions in Sabarimala.
Further actions relating to the Supreme Court verdict will be taken only after holding discussions as per the direction of the court.


For all matters relating to Sabarimala, the tantri community will be approached. They are bound to find a solution for all problems relating to Sabarimala. TDB is not hostile with anybody over the issue, said A Padmakumar.
