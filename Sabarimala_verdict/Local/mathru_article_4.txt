Kozhikode: BJP state president Adv PS Sreedharan Pillai said that they would support the devotees and will join them in the protest against SC verdict on entry of women of all ages at Sabarimala temple. He said this in a press conference held at Kozhikode.
Sreedharan Pillai said that the BJP kept mum all these days because they were learning about the case in detail. The case surrounding Sabarimala is bound to the constitutional rights of individuals. But the court did not consider the devotees' right to worship which is also a constitutional right. This is the demand put forward by the various organizations, he said.
The fight to protect the customs and beliefs will continue until they are achieved. The protests will begin on October 3. The Yuva Morcha and Mahila Morcha will protest and BJP will support them.
Open protest activities and awareness programmes for the public will be organized. This would be the first phase. Then by October 9, Mahila Morcha will also organize protest activities.
