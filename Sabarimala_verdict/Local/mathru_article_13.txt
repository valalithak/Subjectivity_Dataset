Pathanamthitta: The devotees staged a tent protest against the supreme court verdict which allowed unrestricted women entry to Sabarimala. Sabarimala Achara Samrakshana Samithi started a day-night strike by pitching tent in Nilakkal.
The protesters told Mathrubhumi that the strike was against the move which tries to destroy the traditions and faith relating to Sabarimala temple. They pointed out that though protests have been going on all over the state, no action for the devotees was taken by the state government.
They alleged that the affidavit submitted by the state government at Supreme Court was not factual. They clarified that the restriction on women entry was imposed as part of the customs and they will create awareness among the women who visit here violating the customs.
