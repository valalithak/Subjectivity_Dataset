 [][][\nA view of the Lord Ayyappa's shrine at Sabarimala.\n\xa0 ][The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict on a batch of petitions seeking review of its judgment which lifted the bar on menstruating women from worshipping at Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
 A Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi presided over a day-long clash over its September 28, 2018 judgment.
 \n, \nKerala govt opposes pleas seeking review of SC\u2019s Sabarimala verdict\n, A whopping 65 petitions, including review pleas and writs, challenged the authority of the Supreme Court to intervene with a \u201ccenturies\u2019 old\u201d belief that the Sabarimala deity is a Naishtika Brahmachari whose penance should not be disturbed by the entry of women worshippers of the menstruating age of 10 to 50 years.
 On the other hand, senior advocate Indira Jaising, representing Bindu and Kanakadurga \u2014 the two women who fought the odds to enter the Sabarimala premises, said it was the fundamental duty of citizens under Article 51A (h) of the Constitution to \u201cdevelop scientific temper, humanism, spirit of enquiry and reform\u201d. That is what the Supreme Court judgment urges citizens to do.
 \u201cWhat about Article 51A (e)? To promote harmony and common brotherhood...\u201d Justice Rohinton Nariman on the Constitution Bench asked.
 \u201cIt hurts a woman very, very deeply to say she is polluted because she menstruates. The hurt caused by such discrimination goes to the heart of the Constitution,\u201d Ms. Jaising submitted to the Bench.
 The majority judgment in September 2018 concluded that the exclusion of menstruating women from Sabarimala temple was akin to treating them as the children of a \u201clesser God\u201d. It had said exclusion of any kind, especially based on a biological attribute, amounted to practice of untouchability, an abolished social evil.
 But on Wednesday, Nair Service Society (NSS), represented by veteran lawyer K. Parasaran, sought a review of the verdict on the ground that the exclusion at Sabarimala temple was not based on gender or sex, but on religious faith in and character of the deity.
 \n, \nSabarimala: In a U-turn, Kerala's Travancore Devaswom Board supports entry of women of all ages\n, The temple\u2019s chief priest Rajeevaru Kandararu, who is the main review petitioner, argued that \u201cevery devotee has a fundamental right to worship in a temple in a manner which is in sync with the character of the deity\u201d.
 \u201cThanthri [priest] is the father of the deity. Every deity has a character. The Sabarimala deity, unlike in other Ayyappa temples, has the peculiar character of a Naishtika Brahmachari. The essential religious nature of Sabarimala deity is affirmed and perpetuated everyday by the offerings/pujas conducted in the temple. All this rests on this unique character of the deity. Exclusion of women of a certain age is nothing on moral or immoral,\u201d senior advocate V. Giri argued for the priest.
 Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi for the former chairman of Travancore Devaswom Board, which controls the temple, said \u201cIn Hindu religion, god is worshipped in different manifestations... Devotees have to worship in sync with characteristics of that manifestation to attain salvation.\u201d, \u201cWhat is the effect of your Sabarimala judgment? It is a mandamus given to a particular religious community that you shall not hold this belief!\u201d asked senior advocate Shekhar Naphade.
 \u201cHinduism is the most diverse religion on planet Earth. And here, you want to allow only practices or customs which are \u2018universally ethical\u2019 to all Hindus? Is it possible? Surely, that\u2019s not the right approach to take in such a diverse religion?\u201d Mr. Singhvi went on to criticise the September judgment.
 But Kerala government countered the review petition, saying courts can set aside religious practices which oversaw fundamental rights like dignity of women. \u201cTouchstone of our Constitution is \u2018you will not discriminate or exclude\u2019,\u201d senior advocate Jaideep Gupta submitted for the State.
 \xa0, The Travancore Devaswom Board supported the State, saying the spirit of the Sabarimala judgment is equal entitlement for man and woman in society.
 But Ms. Jaising said her two clients have faced death threats and social exclusion for daring to worship at Sabarimala.
 Lastly, advocate P.V. Dinesh, appearing for two other Kerala-based women who filed a contempt of court petition, asked the court, \u201cIf it is believed that a 10-year-old girl child can breach the Naishtika Brahmacharyam of a God, then a child is being portrayed as a sexual object?\u201d][Please enter a valid email address.
