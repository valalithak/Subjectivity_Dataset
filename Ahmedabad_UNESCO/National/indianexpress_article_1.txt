Ahmedabad has just been declared India\u2019s first #WorldHeritage city by @UNESCO,\u201d tweeted Ruchira Kamboj, India\u2019s permanent representative to UNESCO., \u201cFor over 600 years, Ahmedabad has stood for peace, as a landmark city where Mahatma Gandhi began India\u2019s freedom struggle. It has stood for unity with its elegant carvings in its Hindu and Jain temples as well as standing as one of the finest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture and Hindu Muslim art. And beyond this, it epitomizes the United Nation\u2019s objective of sustainable development as it accelerates in its development,\u201d she said during Ahmedabad\u2019s inscription., Spread over 5.43 sq km, the walled city of Ahmedabad was preferred over Mumbai and Delhi during the nominations last year. With a population of 3.75 to 4 lakh, the city\u2019s living heritage being the 600 odd \u2018pols\u2019 or neighbourhoods with clusters of centuries-old residences., Ahmedabad\u2019s nomination was supported by several countries like Turkey, Lebanon, Cuba and Poland. \u201cThe entire credit for this goes to the citizens of the city. It took us 20 years, and now I think the work has just started. We have become a national example and we have to make sure we stand by it. The government will also benefit from this and the old city will get better. People will now show interest in preserving their properties in the old city,\u201d said Debashish Nayak, director of the Centre for Heritage Management at Ahmedabad University, who had launched the first heritage walk in the walled city., \u201cIt started as a small step in 1996 when we started the heritage cell.

We have to set an example for the rest of the country as professionals, citizens and stakeholders. This status would also mean a sharp rise in property prices in the old city. I have observed the rise in price in the last five years, but now it will start shooting up.\u201d, Jigna Desai, assistant professor at Cept University credited the status to Rabindra Vasavada, a retired professor of Cept University, who and his team took six years to put together the dossier for the walled city.
