 Dedicating the \u2018Statue of Unity\u2019 to the nation on Sardar Patel\u2019s birth anniversary, in a ceremony that saw Air Force aircraft shower petals as they flew overhead, Mr. Modi said: \u201cIt is a historic and inspiring occasion for all Indians. I am fortunate to dedicate this statue of Sardar Saheb to the nation.\u201d, The Prime Minister recalled the Congress leader\u2019s contribution in unifying the country after independence as he brought more than 500 princely states on a common platform to join the Union of India.
 \u201cWithout Sardar, we would not have imagined a railway line from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n, \u201cWithout him, one would need to get a visa to visit Gir forest to see lions, or visit Hyderabad to see famous Charminar,\u201d Mr. Modi said, recalling the strategic efforts made by the first Home Minister of India in bringing Junagadh in Gujarat and Hyderabad in south India \u2014 both of which were then controlled by Muslim rulers \u2014 into the Union of India.
 \n, \nGreat unifier and the maker of modern India: Narendra Modi\u2019s tribute to Sardar Patel , Built at a cost of \u20b92,989 crore, the \u2018Statue of Unity\u2019 depicts Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel wearing a traditional dhoti and shawl, towering over the Narmada River and overlooking the Sardar Sarovar dam.
 The statue, described as the world\u2019s tallest given that it exceeds the height of China\u2019s Spring Temple Buddha by 177 feet, was built by Indian construction major Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) in 33 months. The statue was designed by Padma Bhushan-winning sculptor Ram V Sutar.
 \n\n, Mr. Modi also lashed out at those who had questioned the government for spending almost \u20b93,000 crore to build the world\u2019s tallest statue.
 \u201cI find it amusing that when some people of our own country dare to see this initiative from a political view and criticise us as if we have committed a huge crime,\u201d he said, rhetorically asking: \u201cIs remembering the country\u2019s great personalities a crime?\u201d, Among those critical of the project and its cost were local tribals, whose attempts to hold a protest were foiled by the heavy deployment of police along the route to the statue. The local police even detained more than 50 activists and tribal leaders, fearing protests by them.
 \u201cThere is nothing for tribals, who are original inhabitants of forest lands in this area,\u201d said local MLA Chhotubhai Vasava, who has floated the Bhartiya Bhilistan Sena. \u201cInstead of spending \u20b93,000 crore on building a statue, the government should have started some new scheme for tribals,\u201d he said.
 Environmental activist Rohit Prajapati, who was also detained ahead of the inaugural event, said that the statue \u2014 built on a small island in the river \u2014 would cause damage to the Narmada\u2019s ecology.][Please enter a valid email address.
