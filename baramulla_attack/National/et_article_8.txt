Millitants had plans to carry out Uri-type terror strike: BSF
SRINAGAR: The BSF today said the militants, who attacked a joint camp of the force and the army yesterday in north Kashmir's Baramulla district, had plans to carry out Uri-type terror strike on the installation and complimented the personnel for foiling their plans.  "Certainly, they had such plans. There is a fence in front of the bunker in the camp. The equipment, like wire-cutter, GPS and compass, have been recovered there, (so), they (militants) wanted to cut through the fence and certainly had similar plans like the other (Uri) camp," Additional Director General of BSF Arun Kumar told reporters here when asked if the militants wanted to carry out a similar strike like the one in Uri on September 18 that left 19 army men dead.  He was speaking to reporters after offering floral tributes to a BSF jawan who lost his life in the attack in Baramulla last night.  The BSF officer said the forces did an excellent job by preventing the militants from entering the security installation.  "Our jawans sacrificed their supreme life to prevent the militants from entering the camp. They have done an excellent job," Kumar said.  Giving details of the attack, he said the BSF personnel suspected movement of militants at around 10:30 pm and the jawans challenged them.  "The militants opened fire, which was retaliated by the BSF personnel. Then, it seems, they attacked the bunker with UBGL grenades. Our constable said there were two militants but they fled in the night," he said.  Kumar said though there were no specific reports about the movement of militants, "there is a possibility of the presence of militants at some places, but our forces are alert".
