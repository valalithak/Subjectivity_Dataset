BSF and Army repulse Uri-style offensive on Baramulla camp
SRINAGAR: The Army and BSF repulsed an Uri style attack on a camp in Baramulla district of north Kashmir by four terrorists in the wee hours of Monday.  The terrorists managed to flee the spot but not before killing BSF constable Nitin Kumar and injuring his colleagues, constables Varun and Lakhwinder.  Later, a GPS, compass and wire-cutter were found on the banks of the Jhelum from where the terrorists crossed over.  The 46 Rashtriya Rifles camp that came under attack has four BSF bunkers of the nearby 40 battalion camp and were the first to come in the line of fire.  The attack started around 10:30 pm and continued for two hours. “Three to four terrorists fired at our sand bunker from 25 yards away, after a BSF soldier went out with a lit torch to check suspected suspicious movement outside.  The firing alerted the Army and other BSF pickets and they started firing at the terrorists,” BSF DIG Mahender Singh Dev told ET.  He said the terrorists fled towards the civilian area after they failed to enter the camp. “Our men thwarted an Uri style attack,” Dev said.  Constable Kumar was hit by grenade shrapnel and succumbed to his injuries. “The terrorists fled from the scene to the civilian area after the failed attempt to barge into the camp,” Baramulla SSP Imtiaz Hussain added.
