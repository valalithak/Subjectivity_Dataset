Border guard killed in attack on Indian army camp in Kashmir

 The Baramulla police chief, Imtiyaz Hussein, said the militants appeared to have reached the camp by boat on a river that passes through the town, and escaped afterwards. “They fled under the cover of darkness,” he said.
India called its 4 Para special forces unit in to Baramulla and an operation continued into the morning to search and secure the army camp.
Baramulla is a district capital that lies on the road between Srinagar, the summer capital of India’s northernmost state, and the frontier settlement of Uri, where the previous attack took place on 18 September. 
India launched retaliatory “surgical strikes” in the early hours of Thursday against militant camps on the Pakistani side of the line of control and announced it had inflicted significant casualties. Pakistan denied any such attack had taken place.
India’s announcement that it had conducted the cross-border raid was the first in decades, and raised international fears that its campaign to isolate Pakistan diplomatically and punish it militarily could lead to an armed escalation. 
After the Indian operation, the United States urged India and Pakistan to show restraint. On Monday, Pakistan said the two countries’ national security advisers had been in touch in an attempt to calm the situation on the line of control (LoC). 
“Pakistan wants to reduce tensions on LoC and focus on Kashmir,” Sartaj Aziz, a foreign policy adviser to the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, said.
