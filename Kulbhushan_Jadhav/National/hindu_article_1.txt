Former India Naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav was sentenced to death in a Field General Court Martial on April 10, 2017 after three-and-a-half months of trial. He has been accused of espionage and working for the India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW).He was arrested from Balochistan on March 3 last year. The issue has snowballed into a flash point for India-Pakistan relations. India has been repeatedly requesting consular access to Mr. Jadhav while also demanding a certified copy of the charge sheet as well as the judgment. Pakistan has so far denied India’s request 13 times, Mr. Gautam Bambawale, Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad told reporters in the Pakistan capital.In the wake of this, India has cancelled maritime talks with Pakistan that was scheduled for April 17. It is likely that more steps could follow based on Pakistan’s response to India’s latest request for consular access for Mr. Jadhav, according to The Hindu's Special Correspondent.  Read on for an in-depth look into the ongoing case, starting from who Mr. Jadhav is, the events leading up to his arrest in Pakistan and where India-Pakistan relations are headed from here.
