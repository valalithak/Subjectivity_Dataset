Dog that survived wildfire guarded home for weeks
A dog that survived the catastrophic wildfire in Northern California apparently protected the ruins of his home for almost a month until his owner returned. Madison was there waiting when Andrea Gaylord was allowed back to check on her burned property in Paradise this week. Gaylord fled when the November 8 fire broke out. An animal rescuer who responded to Gaylordâs request to check on Madison first spotted the male Anatolian shepherd mix several days later. The dog reunited Friday when Gaylord came back to the property and brought Madison his favorite treat: a box of Wheat Thin crackers. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News.
