For twelve hours we have been using two dedicated hashtags (#CampFireJamesWoods, #SoCalFiresJamesWoods) so people can coordinate finding each other on my @Twitter feed. Just tweet info on missing persons using a hashtag by geography or search for those missing the same way.— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 9, 2018
