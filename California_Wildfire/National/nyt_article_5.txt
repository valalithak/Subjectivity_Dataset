To the Editor: After eight days of evacuation from the raging fire in the major canyon to the west, I returned home and canceled my usual Saturday morning art class. I find my 95-year-old eyes filling as I think of the horror up north in Paradise, and am grateful that my daughter luckily lives in Plumas County.  I think of a not-so-lucky friend who survived only miles from where I write, but whose house is badly damaged. Her orchard and the houses around her are destroyed. But she and her husband and new baby are well, and as my daughter says, “Houses can be rebuilt and plants regrown.”  On my deck, surrounded by towering oaks, it is strangely still, but the first orange-eared squirrel just returned to his daily picnic. I await the canyon wrens, dark-eyed juncos and purple finches. Joe BlausteinTopanga, Calif.
