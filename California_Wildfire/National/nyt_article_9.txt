The Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California’s recorded history, is now 100 percent contained, the state fire agency announced on Sunday. Seventeen days after the fire started, firefighters successfully formed a perimeter around the destructive blaze, Cal Fire officials said. Full containment does not mean that a fire is entirely extinguished, but that firefighters have established a line around it. The authorities have not yet identified the cause of the fire. The Camp Fire burned over 150,000 acres — the equivalent of 10 Manhattan islands — and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, according to the authorities. The fire has claimed at least 85 lives in Butte County, north of Sacramento, where the Camp Fire burned furiously. Thousands have evacuated to makeshift shelters, like a tent city outside a Walmart in Chico. Over 200 people are still unaccounted for in Butte County, according to the sheriff’s office there. Cal Fire said emergency responders were continuing their search efforts. Rains over the last three days helped the firefighters contain the blaze, but they were destructive to homes that have been scorched, and may pose a danger to residents that return home. “With the rain we have been experiencing, residents should be aware of potential risks associated to the weather,” the Butte County Sheriff’s Office warned. “Areas experiencing significant rainfall following a wildfire are at risk for debris flows and flash flooding.”
