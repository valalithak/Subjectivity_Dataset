LONDON — Your invitation is probably not in the mail. Prince Harry and his fiancée, Meghan Markle, announced on Friday that they would invite about 1,200 members of the public to Windsor Castle to celebrate their marriage in May. The couple will welcome a total of 2,640 people to the grounds of their wedding venue to watch the arrival of the bride and groom at the chapel, which will be followed by a carriage procession from the castle, Kensington Palace said in a statement. “Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have said they want their wedding day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations, too,” the palace said. Members of the public from across Britain and from various walks of life will be nominated to attend the celebration. “The couple has asked that the people chosen are from a broad range of backgrounds and ages, including young people who have shown strong leadership, and those who have served their communities,” the palace said. The couple also invited: • 200 people from a range of charities and organizations; • 100 students from two local schools; • 610 members of the Windsor Castle and St. George’s Chapel communities; • 530 members of the Royal Households and Crown Estate. The Palace announced the couple’s engagement in November, after Prince Harry proposed to Ms. Markle at his home in Kensington Palace, after a roast chicken dinner. The wedding will take place on May 19 at 12 p.m. at Windsor Castle’s 15th-century chapel. A reception for friends and family hosted by Prince Charles will follow. The palace said last month that the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, would marry the couple, and that the Right Rev. David Conner, the dean of Windsor, would conduct the service. The queen and other members of the royal family will attend the wedding, along with Ms. Markle’s parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland. The palace said it would release more details about the ceremony in the coming weeks and months.
