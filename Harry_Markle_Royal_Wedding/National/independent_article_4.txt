 Meghan Markle’s wedding dress designs have been revealed

Israeli designer Inbal Dror has been approached to design the gown

On November 27, Kensington Palace announced the engagement of Prince Harry to actress and activist Meghan Markle. 

It has since been announced that they’re going to tie the knot on May 19 next year at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. 

Excitement around the royal wedding has been growing around the world, with people latching onto every minute detail that they can find. 

Today Kensington Palace released official engagement photos of the happy couple taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Frogmore House Windsor.

There is now speculation that a fashion designer has been chosen to design Markle’s wedding dress. 

Inbal Dror, an Israeli haute couture fashion brand, has been contacted by the palace to produce designs for Markle’s wedding dress.

Dror has designed gowns for a number of celebrities, with Beyoncé wearing one of the designs at the Grammys in 2016.

Dror is renowned for her beautiful embroidery and silhouetted figures.

Since images of Dror’s sketches were leaked to TMZ, the brand’s vice president of marketing Yehuda Katzman sent them to The Independent directly.

Each of the three designs features stunning lacework fit for a bride. 

Two of the sketches even include a personal note from the designer herself, writing: “For Meghan Markle with love.”

In a 2015 interview with Brides magazine, Dror spoke about the way in which she works with her clients. 

“I treat all my brides with the same care and attention,” she said. “Every bride is a celebrity.

“A wedding is such a significant event in a woman’s life, and it’s how she feels wearing the dress that emphasises her features, and can make her feel like the queen of the night!”
