Privacy a fundamental right, says Supreme Court: Historic verdict explained
In a landmark and historic judgment, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court today unanimously declared right to privacy a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, setting off far-reaching implications in terms of law and citizenship (LIVE UPDATES).A nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar ruled that "right to privacy is an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 and entire Part III of the Constitution".The nine judges also unanimously overruled the two earlier judgements of the apex court that right to privacy is not protected under the Constitution: the MP Sharma verdict of 1950 and that of Kharak Singh of 1960.The contentious issue of privacy had emerged when the apex court was dealing with a batch of petitions challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for availing the benefits of various social welfare schemes.There has, however, been no Supreme Court ruling specifically on Aadhaar today. The verdict, however, could derail the world's largest biometric identification programme that the government has been pushing for a while.WHAT THE LANDMARK VERDICT MEANS:The verdict would have a bearing on the challenge to the validity of the Aadhaar scheme on the grounds of its being violative of the right to privacy.The verdict is also likely to have a bearing on the challenge to WhatsApp's new privacy policy. The top court is hearing a challenge to the Delhi High Court's September 23, 2016 order by which it allowed WhatsApp to roll out its new privacy policy but stopped it from sharing the data of its users collected up to September 25, 2016, with Facebook or any other related company.The petitioners, who argued for privacy, had contended that the right to privacy was "inalienable" and "inherent" to the most important fundamental right which is the right to liberty.They had said that right to liberty, which also included right to privacy, was a pre-existing "natural right" which the Constitution acknowledged and guaranteed to the citizens in case of infringement by the state.The batch of petitions had challenged the mandatory use of Aadhaar cards as an infringement of privacy. There have also been concerns over data breach.The Centre had termed privacy as a "vague and amorphous" right which cannot be granted primacy to deprive poor people of their rights to life, food and shelter.The Attorney General of India had contended that right to privacy cannot fall in the bracket of fundamental rights as there were binding decisions of larger benches that it was only a common law right evolved through judicial decisions.In a survey conducted earlier this year with over 10,000 people, a majority of citizens had showed concerns about the privacy of their data and said that a law was needed to regulate it.Those surveyed said they are concerned about the privacy of their data, especially in this digital age and 89 per cent of them voted in favour of a privacy law, according to a survey conducted by citizen engagement platform LocalCircles.People showed major concern about the leaking of Aadhaar details, duplicate PAN cards being issued, mobile numbers and email addresses being sold by vendors, credit cards being hacked due to personal information being easily available in the market and the like.ALSO READ | As India debates privacy as a right, a look at how the world views it  ALSO WATCH | Privacy a fundamental right, declares Supreme Court
