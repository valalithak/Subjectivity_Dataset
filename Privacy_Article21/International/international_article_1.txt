Right To Privacy Is A Fundamental Right Under The Indian Constitution, Says Supreme Court

A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court unanimously decided on Thursday that right to privacy is a fundamental right.

The Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar ruled that "right to privacy is an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 and entire Part III of the Constitution".

The nine judges unanimously overruled the two earlier judgements of the apex court--the M P Sharma verdict of 1950 and that of Kharak Singh of 1960--that right to privacy is not protected under the Constitution.

Besides CJI Khehar, the bench comprised of justices Jasti Chelameswar, SA Bobde, RK Agarwal, Rohinton Nariman, AM Sapre, DY Chandrachud, SK Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer. Before pronouncing the judgement, the CJI said that among the nine judges some of them have authored different orders.

The ruling on the highly contentious issue was to deal with a batch of petitions challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar mandatory for availing the benefits of various social welfare schemes. Aadhaar is a 12-digit random number issued by the Indian government to its residents and it requires the resident's biometric and demographic information. Even though Aadhaar is voluntary, the government's move to make it mandatory for availing schemes has raised serious concerns. 

"They have held that this is a fundamental right under Article 21," said Bhushan, "and therefore any law which is made to restrict this fundamental right will have to be examined on the touchstone of Article 21 which means that the court will have to see if that law imposes reasonable restrictions on your right to privacy or not."
