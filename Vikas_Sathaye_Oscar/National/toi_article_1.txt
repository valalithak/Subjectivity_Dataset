Indian engineer part of team awarded sci-tech Oscar
MUMBAI: An engineer raised in Mumbai, Vikas Sathaye, was part of the team that bagged the scientific and engineering award at the Oscars 2018 Scientific and Technical Awards on Saturday. The four-member team was honoured at the Beverly Hills ceremony âfor the concept, design, engineering and implementation of the Shotover K1 Camera Systemâ, which the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences describes as a âsix-axis stabilised aerial camera mountâ that has an âenhanced ability to frame shots while looking straight downâ. In his statement to the press, Sathaye said that in 2009 he joined a new company called Shotover Camera Systems in Queenstown, New Zealand, which is where he worked on the aerial mount. âOne of the reasons to start this company in Queenstown was the natural beauty and stunning scenery which attract a lot of film producers and directors,â he said. âThe camera mount gets attached to the base of a helicopter, which carries the camera and lens. Its primary function is to eliminate any vibration from reaching the camera and thus getting steady footage. The other function for the camera mount is to move the camera head in the desired direction as required by the camera operator, who sits inside the helicopter and uses a joystick to control the camera head movement,â Sathaye explained.
