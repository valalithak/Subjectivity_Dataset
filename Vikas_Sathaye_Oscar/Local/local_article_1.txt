Mumbai based engineer Vikas Sathaye felicitated with an Oscar at science-tech awards

Vikas Sathaye, an engineer from Mumbai has been honored with the Scientific and Technical Award at the Oscar 2018. The award function which was held at Beverly Hills was attended by all the four members of the team - Brad Hurndell, John Coyle Shane Buckham, and Vikas Sathaye. 

They were felicitated for the concept, design, and engineering of the Shotover K1 Camera System.

Vikas Sathaye had joined the company Shotover Camera Systems in 2009 situated at Queenstown and worked on the aerial support. He also revealed that the natural beauty and stunning scenery of Queenstown led him to start this company there as it attracts a lot of film producers and directors.

While talking to media Vikas mentioned, “The camera mount gets attached to the base of a helicopter, which carries the camera and lens. Its primary function is to eliminate any vibration from reaching the camera and thus getting steady footage. The other function for the camera mount is to move the camera head in the desired direction as required by the camera operator, who sits inside the helicopter and uses a joystick to control the camera head movement.”

Sathaye completed a BTech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology and then proceeded to Indian Institute of Science for an MTech in Electronics and Instrumentation.In 1992, he joined an engineering college as an Assistant Professor and stayed on for six years. He started working as an Assistant Manager for Honeywell Process Solutions in 1999. During the next 10 years, he changed a few jobs while working in the embedded systems industry. Finally, in March 2009 he took up a position at Shotover Camera System in New Zealand's Queenstown where the award-winning technology was developed.
