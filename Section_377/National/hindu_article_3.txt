 A five-judge Constitution Bench, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra unanimously held that criminalisation of private consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code is clearly unconstitutional.
 The court, however, held that Section 377 will apply to \u201cunnatural\u201d sexual acts like bestiality. Sexual acts without consent continues to be a crime under the Section.
 In four concurring opinions, the Bench declared the 156-year-old \u201ctyranny\u201d of Section 377 as \u201cirrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary\u201d.
 Section 377 punished homosexuality with a 10-year imprisonment.
 \n, \nSection 377 won\u2019t apply to consensual same-sex acts, says Supreme Court , The prayer for forgiveness came from Justice Indu Malhotra, the lone woman judge on the Constitution Bench. \u201cHistory owes an apology,\u201d she reached out to the rainbow spectrum.
 Justice D.Y. Chandrachud called Section 377 \u201cMacaulay\u2019s legacy\u201d, which continued for 68 years despite a liberal Constitution because of the manifest lethargy of lawmakers. He said the Section shackled the human instinct to love. It had been a reason for tragedy and anguish. \u201cIt is difficult to right a wrong by history. But we can set the course for the future,\u201d he wrote in his separate opinion.
 Justice Chandrachud said decriminalisation of homosexuality was just a step. This case was about people wanting to live with dignity. Citizens cannot be pushed into obscurity by a colonial law.
 \n, \nReactions to Section 377 order | UN calls verdict \u2018first step to full fundamental rights\u2019\n, Section 377 discriminates against a minority solely for their sexual orientation. It violates the right of the LGBTIQ community to \u201cequal citizenship and equal protection of laws\u201d. The court held that bodily autonomy is individualistic. Choice of partner is part of the fundamental right to privacy.
 The Bench set aside the 2013 judgment of the court in the Suresh Koushal case. , Legal experts said this was a much-needed self-correction of a past judicial wrong committed on the LGBTQ community. The verdict would become the foundation for members of the community to seek individual rights like.
 \n, \nFull text of Supreme Court's verdict on Section 377 on September 6, 2018\n, The 2013 judgment upheld Section 377 and set aside the reprieve won by the LGBTQ community through the Delhi High Court verdict of 2009, which decriminalised homosexuality. It had cast the community back into the shadows as \u201cunconvicted felons\u201d.
 The court declared that once a nine-judge Bench has declared privacy to be a part of the fundamental right to life, nothing could stop the Supreme Court from upholding bodily autonomy and sexual orientation as fundamental rights too.
 The CJI, in his separate opinion shared with Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, held that the LGBTQ community possesses equal rights as any other citizen. Any societal repression of their innate and biological sexual orientation is against the fundamental right to free expression. Homosexuality is their order of nature.
 \n, \nHighlights from the Supreme Court's verdict on decriminalising Section 377\n, The CJI said the community needs the rainbow of hope for the sake of humanity. They should be allowed to live with dignity and without pretence about their identity. This verdict is the beginning of a journey towards greater dignity, equality and liberty.
 Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, in his separate opinion, held that homosexuals have a fundamental right to live with dignity. They are entitled to be treated as human beings and should be allowed to imbibe the spirit of fraternity. , Justice Nariman embraced the ''Yogyakarta'' Principles, which recognise freedom of sexual orientation and gender identity as part of human rights, saying they \u201canimate\u201d the right to equality and equal protection by laws.
 Justice Chandrachud said medical science should stop being a party to the stigmatisation of homosexuals by \u201ctrying to cure something that is not even a disease\u201d. Medical professionals and counsellors should tweak their own attitude. Stigmatisation seriously affects members of the LGBTQ community.
 Justice Chandrachud pointed out how variations in sexual orientation have become a reason for blackmail on the Internet. Quoting Lenoard Cohen, he described how \u201cshadows of a receding past\u201d still controlled the quest of LGBTQ community for fulfillment.
 \u201cCivilisation has been brutal,\u201d he wrote.][Please enter a valid email address.
